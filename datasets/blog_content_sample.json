And as I am rushing round the streets of one of the UK's finest\nseaside cities, catching as many live acts as possible, one name that is right\nat the top of my list to see is Georgia Flipo, who goes by the name of G Flip;\nI introduced her on the blog just last month as Australia's answer to Phil\nCollins.  \n  \nThat doesn't mean to say that Georgia is a short bald man with a bad back who\nwent from being a child actor to member of Genesis to one of the most\nsuccessful songwriters of the 80s pop music era. But she can sing and drum and\nsinging drummers are a pretty rare thing, plus she did used to be in a band\n(Empra) before she went solo so the comparison with Collins is valid in my\nopinion.  \n  \nThe initial excitement for G Flip came from just one song. _About You_ has\nbeen on constant rotation at Breaking More Waves HQ from the first day I heard\nit. From the weird droning sound that underpins the track, to its inherent can\n't-get-you-out-of-my-head catchy simplicity, to Geogia's pristine vocal\ndelivery, G Flip struck pop gold on first attempt.  \n  \nBut guess what? She's done it again with song 2. No, not with a cover of\nBlur's _Song 2_ , but her own new song _Killing My Time_. With this one G Flip\ndemonstrates that the art of writing a great pop song isn 't just about a\ncatchy chorus - it's about making the whole bloody thing an earworm to the\npoint where you begin to wonder which part of the song is really the chorus at\nall. You might as well stop what you're doing now because you're going to get\ndrawn away anyway once you press play. And this song is all about distraction,\nalthough in G Flip's case it's not music that is doing the distracting: \"Don't\ndistract me with your body, put your clothes back on, I know where this is\ngoing,\" she sings. Well. That's certainly one way of making someone lose focus\non what they thought they were going to be doing.  \n  \nG Flip plays 2 shows at this year's Great Escape (the chances are that I'll be\nat both) and she also supports Pale Waves in London later this month. _Killing\nMy Time_ is released to streaming services today.  \n  \nFor all the Great Escape tweets and action follow me @BMWavesBlog  \n**  \n** **G Flip - Killing My Time**  \n  \n\n","date_published":"2018-06-05T08:00:00.000Z","dek":null,"direction":"ltr","domain":"breakingmorewaves.blogspot.com","excerpt":"If you follow Breaking More Waves on Twitter, beware, because for the next few days there will be lots of tweets coming from The Great Es...","lang":"en","lead_image_url":"https:\/\/3.bp.blogspot.com\/-5K_9cCpZqVo\/WvvR3GSR1qI\/AAAAAAAARTs\/a3XbKzPFrW4YkeDr_eUjXxY3I2O7i0IUACLcBGAs\/w1200-h630-p-k-no-nu\/gflip.jpg","next_page_url":null,"pages_rendered":null,"rendered_pages":1.0,"title":"New Music: G Flip - Killing My Time","total_pages":1.0,"url":"http:\/\/breakingmorewaves.blogspot.com\/2018\/05\/new-music-g-flip-killing-my-time.html","word_count":444},{"author":null,"content":"Tags G Flip Georgia Flipo\n\nBased in London, England, they are a queer focused music journalist and most\ncommonly found covered in glitter.

This single beings with pulsing synth beats that immediately center\nthe listener's attention solely on each passing note. As the music continues\nand the first verse of this very modern track truly starts, Brownings vocal\nskills are captivating and bring the listener into a bright new world that is\npainted by each lyrically infused beat. With the bright synth loops that\ncreate a joyful soundscape, the track becomes a pleasure to listen to and\ndistracts from the events of the methodical and, at times, monotonous\npressures of daily life.\n\nWhile speaking of this new project Browning stated,\n\n> After listening to this record I hope people feel like they've gone on a\nsmooth psychedelic journey through a colorful musical world. I wanted to\ncreate an album that people would want to play in their homes whilst cooking\ndinner or getting high and imagine what they're hearing comes from a land\ncreated by Jim Henson - or perhaps they're listening a lost George Harrison\nalbum recorded in the Caribbean and discovered on a VHS tape 30 years later.\n\nWithout a doubt, Browning succeeded in the enormous feat and, like all of his\nfans, we are excited to see what new music he has in store for us in the\nupcoming months. As the title suggests, all those who have the pleasure of\nlistening to this track will feel the warmth of the lyrics and the comfort\nthat this uplifting track has to offer.

Morimoto, a former member of Dark World\nwho moved to Chicago from western Massachusetts in 2014, shares a breezy,\nconversational sensibility with locals like Saba, Joey Purp, and Chance the\nRapper. Even though he didn't grow up in the city, his approach to songcraft\nfits right in with its spirit. His new track \"People Watching,\" from the\nforthcoming _Cannonball!_ LP, floats his voice over waves of saxophone and\nsynthesizers, both of which Morimoto played himself. As he says in the lyrics,\n\"I don't have a band \/ I don't need a band.\"\n\n_Cannonball!_ comes out May 4 on Sooper Records, the indie label founded by\nfellow Chicago oddball Nnamdi Ogbonnaya. It's a natural collaboration: Both\nmusicians have a knack for folding narrative into offbeat, genre-agnostic\nsongs, and both play enough instruments that they can put together complex\ntracks single-handedly.\n\nOver the phone from Chicago, Morimoto spoke with The FADER about  \"People\nWatching\" and what it's been like to settle into Chicago's vibrant music\ncommunity.\n\n**You and Nnamdi Ogbonnaya have such compatible approaches to making music.\nHow did you end up working together to put out your next album?**\n\nNnamdi came to one of my shows when I first moved to Chicago. I had seen his\nmusic before  -- someone had shown me some of his videos. I loved his music\nwhen I found it. It was like, \"Someone else does what I do, only better!\" I\nwas secretly fanboying out when we met. Then we just started hanging out,\nmaking funny songs, and then he started Sooper Records a year and a half ago\nwith Glenn [Curran]. I love all their releases, so I was really excited when\nthey hit me up to do a record.\n\n**Has living in Chicago for the past four years affected your approach to\nmaking music?**\n\nTotally. There 's a lot of instrumentalists and vocalists and songwriters here\nthat push me in a cool way. It can definitely be its own world; there's a\ncertain Chicago musicality. There's a lot of really amazing women in Chicago\nright now making songs that are almost standards in terms of how solid the\nsongwriting is. They've definitely inspired me to be stricter with myself in\nterms of being tasteful about writing.\n\n**You play saxophone on this record and you also do your own vocals. What do\nyou learn from playing sax that you can apply to singing, and vice versa?**\n\nI 've played saxophone the longest of any instrument, since I was 10. There's\na lot of melodies and ideas I can communicate on the saxophone that I can't\nwith my voice. I'm not trained vocally at all. There's a lot of ways in which\nI try to mimic how I play saxophone vocally, which is funny, because the\nsaxophone is built to try to mimic a voice. Lately I've been obsessed with a\nrecord I found by this lady called Vi Redd. She's a singer and a saxophonist,\nand she's a really good example of someone whose vocal melodies are something\nshe would play on saxophone. You can hear that really clearly. She's amazing.  \n\n","date_published":"2018-03-27T00:00:00.000Z","dek":null,"direction":"ltr","domain":"www.thefader.com","excerpt":"Singer, rapper, and multi-instrumentalist Sen Morimoto makes the kind of music you could easily imagine wafting out of the top story of a two-flat greystone during a hot summer night in Chicago.&hellip;","lang":"en","lead_image_url":null,"next_page_url":null,"pages_rendered":null,"rendered_pages":1.0,"title":"Sen Morimoto is his very own backup band on \u201cPeople Watching\u201d","total_pages":1.0,"url":"http:\/\/www.thefader.com\/2018\/03\/27\/sen-morimoto-people-watching-premiere","word_count":549},{"author":null,"content":"If there are four words that best describes Individualist's WaWaNe, it would\nbe: H&M, summer, and good vibes.

After meeting during their respective\ncollegiate musical pursuits, the two bonded quickly over their love of old\nblues records and new electro pop tracks. Deciding to create music together\nwas a natural progression of their friendship, and over years of producing\nmusic and writing songs together for television and for other artists, the\nidea of Soft Streak was born. Still in its infancy, the project affords\nSchachne and Toy the ability to express their own creativity, inspired not\nonly by classic albums, but also by the unique culture of their SoCal home.\n\nSoft Streak's debut single is \" **Ride** ,\" an unbelievably cool track full of\nbeats that will coax your hips into swaying before you even realize what's\nhappening. As the track swaggers along, Schachne's relaxed, rasping vibrato\nhums along, backed by a chorus of angelic harmonies. The song describes the\ndesire to give up control of oneself, the need for excitement within a dull\nexistence: \" _I 'll be your getaway car \/ Down for the ride if we go too far \/\nYou'll take control just before we crash \/ You'll let me know if i go too\nfast._\" If you've ever fantasized about running away from the tedium of\neveryday life, this song is sure to resonate down to your very soul.\n\n","date_published":"2018-05-16T21:00:26.000Z","dek":null,"direction":"ltr","domain":"girlundergroundmusic.com","excerpt":"Soft Streak\u2019s debut single is a seriously danceworthy track sure to awaken the restlessness inside of you.","lang":"en","lead_image_url":"https:\/\/girlundergroundmusic.files.wordpress.com\/2018\/05\/soft-streak-press-picture-2.jpg?w=1200","next_page_url":null,"pages_rendered":null,"rendered_pages":1.0,"title":"Soft Streak\u2019s \u2018Ride\u2019 is Your Escapist\u00a0Fantasy","total_pages":1.0,"url":"https:\/\/girlundergroundmusic.com\/2018\/05\/16\/soft-streaks-ride-is-your-escapist-fantasy\/","word_count":237},{"author":null,"content":"**Rising Bristol-based electronic artistHenry Green shares his new single\n'Another Light' and announces the release date for debut album 'Shift', out\nMarch 30th via Akira Records.**\n\nThere's a beautiful fluidity to 'Another Light', as its evocative electronics\nflutter into a solid, cleansing, downtempo dance beat on the chorus. **Henry\nGreen** injects his own personality, imagination and a natural ambience into\nthe track alongside his distinctive vocal, vivid lyrics and unique electronic\narrangements.\n\nThere 's also a really wonderful seasonal feel, as 'Another Light' shivers\nwith a shimmering, glacial winter chill, while simultaneously feeling like its\nready to transition into the next season.

I 've woken up in the middle of the night with\nthis tune going through my brain. I've found myself singing it at work. I've\nfound myself being able to think of nothing else. You have been warned. You\nmay become obsessed.\n\n  \n  \nOn her trip to the UK in May, besides Great Escape (where G-Flip plays two\nofficial shows) she will also be at Dot to Dot festival and will also be\nsupporting Pale Waves at their biggest UK show so far at Heaven in London.

Yet, the Los Angeles-based artist's past releases\nhave proven to be full of surprises, such as \"I Really Want You To Hate Me\"\nand her addictive pop-rock single \" **Lemon Eyes**. \" Taking a heavier\ndirection and more enjoyable construction of sounds, \"Numb\" is dynamically an\nexplosive range of alt-rock and perfected angst that we began to hear peak on\nher debut EP, _Sorry (2015)_.\n\nWith a fiery break, and hoarse vocals that completely gives the track a new\nway of life, \"Numb\" is admired in this time for its versatility within\ncomposition. Myers' sweet, sing-song portrayal on the first verses misleads\ninto an bat of confusion, \" _I 'm in your custody \/ But I'm not a criminal \/ I\ncan be your next best thing,_\" while other parts showcase a grittier and\nfueled set of pipes. The added weight that _bares upon her shoulders_\ncirculates within the words and are thrust against crunchy effects and heavy\nbass lines.\n\nThe track's truth is spoken within the lyrics, adding fuel to the fire and\nexplained more so by Myers: \"'Numb' relates to the many pressures of life and\nour reactions to this weight. It has to do with our society, how we relate to\nothers and how we relate to ourselves. When this burden becomes too much and\nwe can no longer run\u2026 we essentially numb out.\" As we absorb the momentum that\nMyers has created, we fundamentally realize that at one point in life we all\nhave been forced to run away from our numbness or stand cold.

Not only were her jagged and gritty songs sonically powerful and\nlyrically intense but her videos were admirably disturbing, drawing you into\nher dark world. The tunes were sufficiently impressive to connect in her home\ncountry, where her album charted on the Billboard Top 100, but in here in the\nUK there seemed to be little or no fanfare for her work.  \n  \nSince the release of _Sorry_ Meg has been seemingly lying low, but has now\nannounced a forthcoming second album, _Take Me To The Disco_ , due July 20th.\nOf this record she says: \"I started this album in June of 2016. I wrote over\n50 songs, recorded in some form 30 or more of those, hiked 2,874 2\/3 miles,\ntook 1,246.5 poops, cried a whopping 942 times and laughed a lot too. I moved\nfrom Los Angeles to Nashville and then back to Los Angeles. I watched as\npeople debated whether I looked better with long hair or short hair.\"  \n  \nThere's probably a little bit too much information there about the poops\n(especially half a one - how do you do that?), but importantly you can now\nhear new music from _Take Me To The Disco_.  \n  \nDespite the name of the album, some of the titles of the songs suggest that\nwe're not in for a happy day-glo pop album with the likes of _Tear Me To\nPieces_ , _Funeral_ , _Little Black Death_ and new single _Numb_ all\nfeaturing. _Numb_ is a raging rock tune full of throaty riffs and big dynamics\nthat deals with the feeling of crushing psychological burden placed on her by\nothers:  \"I hate the feeling of this weight upon my shoulders, pushing the\npressure down on me, you think you want the best for me but nothing really\nmatters, if you force it won't come, I guess I'm feeling numb,\" she roars\nbefore adding \"I don't want to grow up la la la.\"  \n  \nIt's a tense and vociferous song that bodes well for the full-length.

But as I dug deeper, I found that it goes back to some\nearly childhood stuff and how shutting down, or escaping, felt like the safer\nthing to do.\"\n\nMyers' new album was co-written with producer Christian \"Leggy\" Langdon and\nfeatures Victor Indrizzo on drums and the Section Quartet on six songs.\n\nAdds Myers: \"Listening back to some of these songs made me realize what I was\nreally writing about \u2026 what was underneath it all. On the surface, I thought I\nwas writing about love loss but I've learned it goes much deeper than that.\nIt's going back to the child in me that needed to be healed. I've always\nwritten from a true place, but in getting to know myself better, I'm now\nwriting from an even deeper level of honesty.\"\n\n **||| Stream:** \"Numb\"\n\n **||| Live:** Meg Myers performs June 25 at the Echo.\n\n **||| Previously:** Live at the El Rey, \"Sorry,\" \"Go\"\n\n###  _Related_\n\nLearn more\n\nOur editorial newsletter is your ticket to upcoming shows and free stuff.\n\n","date_published":"2018-04-27T15:44:55.000Z","dek":null,"direction":"ltr","domain":"buzzbands.la","excerpt":"Meg Myers returns with an explosive new single, \"Numb,\" and the news that her sophomore album will be out July 22.","lang":"en","lead_image_url":"http:\/\/buzzbands.s3.amazonaws.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/04\/27001930\/megmyers-brantleygutierrez-1.jpg","next_page_url":null,"pages_rendered":null,"rendered_pages":1.0,"title":"Stream: Meg Myers, 'Numb' \u2013 buzzbands.la","total_pages":1.0,"url":"http:\/\/buzzbands.la\/2018\/04\/27\/stream-meg-myers-numb\/","word_count":348},{"author":null,"content":"A new Beach House album is coming.

He has been\nreleasing his creations for over 13 years, with a sound that pivots around\njazz-funk and world music. Next month Benini is to release, _Drumphilia volume\n1, _ a new album that he describes as, \"a _rhythmic experiment that sits on\nthe fault line between traditional instrumentation and analogue electronics.\"_\n\nThe project is a response to many years spent working with, learning about and\nlistening to African and Caribbean percussion where traditional rhythmic\ninfluences are combined with analogue drum machines and drum synths. The aim\nof this project was to create melody and texture using only carefully tuned\npercussion instruments, whether organic or electronic. Bass lines were created\nby blending drum synth tones with the acoustic marimbula, a traditional\nCaribbean instrument that was often used in place of a bass guitar. Melodies\nwere created with everything from log drums and thumb pianos to early Soviet\ndrum modules and the trailblazing Pearl Syncussion SY-1.  \n\nWritten, performed, arranged and produced by Andrea Benini, _Drumphilia Vol.\n1_ is _\" a journey inspired by early African Electronic music and modern\nbeats.\"_ The record features an array of interesting instrumentation, all of\nwhich are played by Benini, including: electronic drums, analog drum machines,\ndrum synthesizers, bass synthesizers, syncussion, percussions, log drum,\nmarimbula, kalimba, sansula\n\n_El Guerrero (_translating as _The Warrior) _ is the album's first available\ntrack brimming with inspiriting layers of hypnotic, dazzling percussion. It's\nlively, yet gentle dynamic textures dance and explore with lighthearted\nclarity as they fuse together to create one vibrant melody.

The duo has just released a\nnew song called **\" Body Language\" **, a subtle blend of Pop and electronic\nmusic.\n\nThe MLU project has been successful since the first EP **\" Astro Travel\nThrough Life\" **, released on Junkyard Connections in 2014 and powered by the\nflagship track \"Clinton Space Funk\". Quickly considered as cult track Sweden,\nMLU keeps its momentum and develops **a specific sound** over the releases and\nmeetings on different labels such as Superconscious, Tim Sweeneys and recently\n**Beats In Space**. Also, the duo maje a stop in 2016 with the Swedish\ninstitution **Studio Barnhus** , run by Kornel Kovacs, Petter Nordkvist **Tom\nLagerman** et **Niklas Janzon** , originaires de Stockholm et amis de longue\ndate, forment ensemble **Mount Liberation Unlimited**. Le duo vient tout juste\nde nous d evoiler un nouveau morceau sobrement intitule \" **Body Language** \",\nsubtil melange de Pop et musique electronique.\n\nLe projet MLU rencontre le succes des le premier EP \" **Astro Traveling\nThrough Life** \", sortie sur Junkyard Connections en 2014 et propulse par le\ntitre phare \"Clinton Space Funk\". Rapidement considere comme un morceau culte\nen Suede, MLU poursuit sur sa lancee et elabore **un son propre a eux **au fil\ndes sorties et rencontres sur les differents labels tels que Superconscious,\nTim Sweeneys et plus recemment **Beats in Space**. Le duo atterri notamment en\n2016 sur l 'institution suedoise **Studio Barnhus** , label mene par Kornel\nKovacs, Petter Nordkvist et Axel Boman.\n\nQuelques mois plus tard, Mount Liberation Unlimited retrouve un succes\nfulgurant avec \" **Double Dance Lover** \" sorti sur ce fameux Studio Barnhus.\nCe morceau confirme le style si particulier de MLU a cheval entre **Pop et\nElectro-House**. Un titre si bien jou e par les Djs en club qu'a la radio sur\nles ondes suedoises. S'en suit une tournee, ou Tom et Niklas propose un live,\nconfectionne depuis quelques temps deja et qui leur ouvre les portes des\nfestivals Sonar, Dimensions ou bien meme du Panomara Bar\/Berghain. **Un live d\n'une importance considerable **pour le groupe desireux de passer le cap des\nstudios d'enregistrements a la scene ou les instruments traditionnels prennent\nplace. Un desir plutot coherent au vue de la **richesse musicale des\nmorceaux** , particulierement bluffant dans la version Disko Dubb de Double\nDance Lover, delicieusement sublimee par cette touche psychedelique.\n\nMount Liberation Unlimited revient donc avec un nouveau titre \u00ab Body Language\n\u00bb sorti sur le label Munichois **Permanent Vacation**. Un morceau plus rod e\net quadrille que les explorations instrumentales de Double Dance Lover mais\n**terriblement efficace**. En effet, aucune difficult e a retrouver la patte\ntoujours aussi reconnaissable du duo, notamment dans la longueur des morceaux,\nBody Language se demarque cependant par **ses allures Pop conventionnelles** ,\nmatine de Disco et House. Le titre s'accompagne d'une version Mouth Mix, dans\nun style saccade et deconstruit, rappelant les armes DJ Koze et caracterise\nprincipalement par un aspect plus electronique comme \" **interpr etation\nSuedoise de la Chicago-House **\", nous apprend le communique. Tom et Niklas\nentreprennent une direction legerement nouvelle donc, tout en restant fidele a\nce son qu'ils ont su fa\u00e7onner depuis le premier EP.and Axel Boman.\n\nA few months later, Mount Liberation Unlimited find success again with **\"\nDouble Dance Lover\" **released on Studio Barnhus. This piece confirms the\nparticular style of MLU between **Pop and Electro-House**. A track so well\nplayed by the club DJs than on Swedish radio. Following their success, Tom and\nNiklas goes on tour and offer a live, which opens the doors of festivals as\nSonar, Dimensions or even Panomara Bar \/ Berghain. **A really important live**\nfor the group who want to ga from record studios to the stage where\ntraditional instruments take place. A logical desir regading the dazzling\nmusical richness of the Disko Dubb version of Double Dance Lover, deliciously\nsublimated by this psychedelic touch.\n\nMount Liberation Unlimited returns with this new track \"Body Language\"\nreleased on the Munich label **Permanent Vacation**. A piece more grind than\nthe instrumental explorations of Double Dance Lover but **really effective**.\nIndeed, any difficulty in finding the recognizable style of the duo,\nespecially in the length of the pieces, Body Language is distinguished by its\nconventional Pop, full of Disco and House. The track go along with a mix mouth\nversion, in a jerky and deconstructed way, more or less like DJ Koze style but\nmainly in an electronic aspect like **\" the Swedish interpretation of the\nChicago-House \" **.

This week\nthey've announced the release of their debut album proper, _Invitation To Her\n's_, due on August 24th through Heist or Hit.\n\nAlong with the announcement of the album they have aired the track 'Low Beam',\nwhich they tell us is \"a commentary on toxic masculinity, viewed through the\neyes of a biker who feels alienated by the gangs in the scene, without feeling\nany weaker. He's a lone wolf type character.\"\n\nAny newcomers to Her's will immediately feel ingratiated in their presence, as\nthey lay out soft-edged guitars and tender vocals, spinning a tale of self-\nexamination and loneliness. 'Low Beam' immediately conjures memories of the\ninsouciant charm of early Mac Demarco and the off-the-wall character of Ariel\nPink, as Her's spin the tale of this biker out of his element in the midst of\npunks and posers. Her's make 'Low Beam' into a breezy and undeniably catchy\nsong, and we feel the humanity of this strayed soul as we hear about his\nfantasies, how he's \"just a lover boy,\" and how he's \"dreaming of different\nthrills\" \\- all told in effete tones.

Her's' Audun Laading and\nStephen Fitzpatrick may both be Merseyside migrants, the latter from Barrow\nand the former from Norway, but the duo have made a musical home of Liverpool.\nBrought together through a chance encounter in a university canteen by their\nshared love of off-kilter humour and art, Her's have shaped the very texture\nof Liverpool alongside peers like Trudy and the Romance and Pizzagirl. The\nnucleus of the Merseyside scene surrounding these groups finds its identity\nthrough humour and imagination. They're voracious consumers of music across\nstyles and eras, and it shows in their mutant retro-futurist sound. All things\nconsidered, 'Invitation To Her's' is already proving to be one of the most\nfree and inspired indie rock debuts this island has seen for a while.\n\n**' Invitation to Her's' released August 24th on Heist or Hit and second\nsingle 'Low Beam' is out now.**\n\n**Her 's Live**\n\n**JULY**\n\n15th - LONDON, Citadel Festival 22nd - SHEFFIELD, Tramlines Festival\n\n28th - BUDE, Leopallooza Festival\n\n**AUGUST**\n\n27th - NORTHAMPTONSHIRE, Greenbelt Festival\n\n**OCTOBER**\n\n6th - Manchester, Neighbourhood Festival 10th - Berlin, Maze 11th - Cologne,\nAcephale 13th - Paris, Le Point Ephemere 17th - Liverpool, Arts Club Loft 18th\n- Reading, South Street Arts Centre 19th - Brighton, Sticky Mike's Frog Bar\n24th - LONDON, Tufnell Park Dome 25th - Cambridge, Portland Arms 26th -\nLeicester, The Cookie 27th - Dublin, Whelans Upstairs\n\n30th - Newcastle, Think Tank\n\n**NOVEMBER**\n\n1st - Leeds, Brudenell Social Club (Community Room)  \n2nd - Glasgow, The Great Eastern\n\nTickets here:\n\nMark Millar is the Founder of xsnoize.com\n\nFav Band(s): U2, R.E.M, The Stone Roses, Oasis, The Verve, The Charlatans,\nHappy Mondays, Mansun + loads more\n\nFav Album: Achtung Baby - U2\n\nFollow Mark on Twitter: @markontheweb  \nEmail: mark@xsnoize.com\n\nPlease follow and like us:\n\n","date_published":"2018-05-24T01:57:07.000Z","dek":null,"direction":"ltr","domain":"www.xsnoize.com","excerpt":"Following on from last year\u2019s 9 track compilation \u2018Songs Of Her\u2019s\u2019, the Liverpool duo\u2019s upcoming debut LP \u2018Invitation to Her\u2019s\u2019 released August 24th on Heist or Hit will be their most significant step&hellip;","lang":"en","lead_image_url":"http:\/\/www.xsnoize.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/05\/2c1810d3-8d31-4da2-aa30-5634b3f87509.png","next_page_url":null,"pages_rendered":null,"rendered_pages":1.0,"title":"HER\u2019S share details of their debut album and stream a second cut \u201cLow Beam\u201d","total_pages":1.0,"url":"http:\/\/www.xsnoize.com\/hers-share-details-of-their-debut-album-and-stream-a-second-cut-low-beam\/","word_count":606},{"author":"Cerys\nKenneally","content":"The chillwave\/slacker rock duo Her's have announced their debut album\n_Invitation To Her 's_, as well as sharing new single \"Low Beam\"\n\nContinuing their contagious slacker sound, Liverpool's Her's have revealed\nnews of their debut album _Invitation To Her 's_ to come later this summer.\n\n\"Low Beam\" is the second track lifted from their upcoming project, following\non from 'Love On The Line (Call Now)' that was revealed in early April.\n\nSpeaking about the new track, the duo explained, \"Low Beam is our foray into\nrock 'n roll sleaze core, pop out your leather jacket, grease your hair and\ncruise around town at night, whilst not forgetting to remain the emotional\nbeing that you are.

Though\nthey released their non-album _Tween_ in 2016, a collection of tracks crafted\nduring recording sessions for various albums that never quite made it onto\nany, the band 's latest _The Louder I Call, the Faster It Runs_ is the band 's\nmuch more confident entry into it's official discography. Baltimore duo no\nlonger and separated by half-a-country, Jenn Wasner and Andy Stack have made\nthe most of their lack of proximity and the cross-country trading of ideas has\nresulted into newfound creative peaks for the two. After the guitar-less synth\npop of _Shriek_ , it was anyone's guess what a Wye Oak album would sound like\nas the two essentially rejected their status as indie rock darlings in favor\nof the more fulfilling artistic freedom that Wasner's shift from guitar\ngranted them. \"The Louder I Call, the Faster It Runs\", the title track from\nthe duo's forthcoming fifth studio album of the same name essentially finds\nWasner returning to the guitar after demonstrating the full breadth of her\nmulti-instrumentalism on _Shriek_ while her and Andy Stack continue to push\nthe sound of Wye Oak into bold new directions.\n\n\"The Louder I Call, the Faster It Runs\" is mammoth in sound while being\ncomposed of so many intricate moving layers. Considering its sprawling\nopening, it's hard to imagine it isn't the first track on the new record but\nthat honor belongs to \"(tuning)\". Instead Wye Oak offer the title track as the\nfirst taste of new record which functions as an effective synthesis of the\nduo's oeuvre. No longer relying on particular rules to dictate the\nformation\/crafting of songs, Wasner and Stack instead focused on sifting\nthrough various musical ideas and following the most fruitful. While \"Watching\nthe Waiting\", the only truly new song on _Tween_ , was much more of a direct\ncommentary on where the band were post- _Shriek_ , \"The Louder I Call, the\nFaster It Runs\" functions much more as a sort of ritualistic mantra. Wasner\nrepeats the titular phrase often with occasional tweaks and it is the only\nlyric that fully survive the surging climax throws fragments of previous\nuttered lyrics back in new unfinished configurations along with the detritus\nof musical ideas smashed to bits and blown back with intense shredded guitar\nparts. Wasner highlights the comfort of familiar patterns as a means to remain\nadrift against a sea of uncertainty and the mantra-like chorus echoes that\nsentiment entirely.\n\n_The Louder I Call, the Faster It Runs_ , the fifth studio album from Wye Oak\nis out April 6th on Merge.

While\nwaiting to hear a first mix I was excited about how the two worlds would sound\ncombined: From the first notes I heard, it made complete sense. Very Kiasmos,\nvery Josin. They used the right essentials from the original and added their\ndeepness and emotional colour in an amazing way. The way they kept the vocal\npart completely unfiltered and raw is exactly how I see the vocals in that\ntrack. For me, the remix raises the song to a new level and inspires me back\nfor my own work.\"\n\nThe original track was written last summer during a campervan trip in Norway\non a ridiculously small, battery-powered keyboard. \"It was fun because I was\nable to work on the melodies basically everywhere: On a kayak in the middle of\nthe ocean, while hiking, while waiting for ferries\" explains Josin. \"Sometimes\nwriting on the go and with less gear makes one focus on the essentials more.\nCompany is about trying to become one with something but not succeeding. It\u00b4s\na solitary, careful declaration of love.\"\n\nLast year Josin released her debut acclaimed EP 'Epilogue' via Swedish\nindependent label Dumont Dumont (Ry X, Jose Gonzalez). The EP sees a dynamic\nblend of electronic jolts, enhanced by keyboards and haunting poetic vocals\nthat draw on a variety of traditions, from classical to electronic. As a self-\ntaught producer, Josin is always experimenting, incorporating the electronical\nworld into her writing as well as composing string arrangements.\n\nJosin will be performing at this year's Great Escape Festival in Brighton on\nMay 18th at 8.30pm at the Unitarian Church.\n\nPosted on May 11, 2018, in stream and tagged Josin, Kiasmos, remix.

It's 10\nPM at Austin's historic Scoot Inn, and ThisSongIsSick is showcasing artists by\nthe likes of Louis Futon, and Classixx. All I need is a lighter. I meander my\nway past the bar and find a stool to set up shop, I dig through my purse for\nmy Turkish Royals, and a lighter. Naturally, I have no luck on the lighter.

But despite the posse\napproach, \"Sinner\" is mostly a showcase for Wilson, who raps playful, sing-\nsong couplets about rejection and perseverance without ever taking himself too\nseriously. Near the end of his second verse, after some casual repentance (\"I\ndone a lot of shit that I couldn't record\"), he turns a corner and finds the\nlight: \"Now I see in different colors like I'm Yo Gabba Gabba\/Rhymes on a\nnigga like I wrote Llama Llama.\" On \"Sinner,\" Wilson's uplifting swagger is on\nfull display as he hammers out his difficult, hard-won mission statement.\n\n","date_published":null,"dek":null,"direction":"ltr","domain":"pitchfork.com","excerpt":"The 22-year-old rapper Ric Wilson rose through the same creative writing program in Chicago as Chance the Rapper and Kweku Collins","lang":"en","lead_image_url":"https:\/\/media.pitchfork.com\/photos\/5ae738b123bb310b1c0efe38\/1:1\/w_500\/ric%20wilson%20ep%20cover.jpg","next_page_url":null,"pages_rendered":null,"rendered_pages":1.0,"title":"Listen to \u201cSinner\u201d [ft.

Check her brand new single  \"wrong\" and our interview\nwith the artist below.\n\n**_HighClouds_ : How are you finding juggling being an artist with the running\nof your label; _Sleep Well Records_? Do you feel it 's important for you to\nhave that power over your output?**\n\nI really like keeping things separate, so I am actually not on my record\nlabel! I am on _Rhyme and Reason Records_. I enjoy being busy though and\ntrying to push myself to do as much as possible and well. I have been working\nwith indie record labels for my day job now for almost five years so it 's\nnothing new to me. I really want to use the label to break the underdogs and\ntake the chances other bigger labels are not willing to take yet.\n\n**Your \"take your broken heart, make it into art\" captioned single in support\nof Planned Parent came at a very divisive time for world politics, how was\nthat idea born into a solid plan of action?**\n\nWhen Trump was elected president the only positive thing I saw that could come\nof this was artists getting to work and speaking out with their art. The week\nafter the election I just felt so so deeply sad. Not even angry, just sad. I\nwrote \"It's The Way\" in about 10 minutes in an attempt to turn those emotions\ninto a song and make myself feel better. We locked in a show the day of\ninnaguration and I was like ef it. Im going to record this this week and put\nit out, and play it at this show. It was a very last minute decision, which\nbusiness wise I hate, but I just felt I needed to do it. I'm really happy I\ndid.\n\n**I feel a lot of your music comes from a very vulnerable place, is the\nrelease for you as cathartic as it perhaps comes across when listening to\ntracks like 'just cuz you can't'?**\n\nThis releases focuses on the next stage of my loss. The EP came from a\nheartbroken place where I just felt immense loss. This next release picks up\nwhere \"snowed in \/\/ there's no one new around you\" let off and touches on the\nanger I had started to feel.\n\n**And following on from that, the video for that appears to take place in your\nown personal space, do you find it easy to let people into that as\nfans\/\/admirers of your music?**\n\nWhen I made the video for \"just cuz you can't\" I didn't really think about it\nbecause I didn't expect to have fans haha. I made the video about 4 months\nbefore my first track was even released! It was important to me to have the\nvideo take place in my apartment because that was where I made the entire EP\nand I wanted to keep that aesthetic.\n\n**Your debut EP featured song titles featuring Tinder references which are\nquite tongue in cheek in their meaning, could you maybe tell us the reasoning\nbehind choosing those titles as pop culture references?**\n\nHonestly I was just drunk one night and swiping through. I got to the end and\nit said \"There's no one new around you.\" and I thought if taken out of context\nit was a beautiful phrase and perfectly described how I was feeling at the\ntime.\n\n**Whereas many of your tracks occupy a soothing dissociative state, 'Run'\nfeels much more heightened and present in terms of instrumentation and the\nconfidence in your vocal, did it come from a more intense emotional space than\nother tracks?**\n\nI think so, well it was the first time I recorded live drums and bass. The\nsong in general always felt way bigger to me than anything I had written for\nthe first EP. It's also starting to touch on that angry \/ empowering theme of\nthe next record.\n\n**What was it like to take part in and throw your own Showcase as a part of\n_SXSW Festival_ as such a still relatively emerging artist?**\n\nIt was amazing!

Think a moment of mindfulness made into music.\n\nThe track opens with a series of synths, foreshadowing possibility and\ninviting the listener to ponder, before blissful bass and a resounding upbeat\nrolls in. This is music made to savour; perhaps even more precious in an age\nwhere so much sound seems frantic or forced under pressure, in its attempt to\nmake an impression.\n\nLyrically it also has a delicious lingering quality as Oddnesse reflects: \"\n_Maybe you 're happy and in another life\/ Maybe it's yet to arrive_.\" The bass\nreally resounds in this track, and combined with the sensuous, sashaying\nvocals lends a meditative quality the listener can ease themselves into.\n\nThen the chorus arrives - and although its lines are simple \" _I know you see\nit\/ When you believe it_ ,\" the blend with bass is built-up with a hi-hat\nintensity to hit an anthemic accessibility. Imagine the verses are ripples and\nthis chorus is the warm wash of a wave. The ongoing lyrics seem to confirm\nthis sensuousness: \" _Everywhere I go, I 'm right at home\/ Infinite galaxies\nto call my own_,\" Oddnesse crafting her voice to caress every syllable, with a\nnotable summery suitability.\n\nThere's another blissful burst of chorus the second-time round, before a well\nthought out fade-out, which adds additional intensity to this strategically\nsimple tune. The bass, by this point, has developed a more extended,\nreflective quality, as the tone is topped with appreciation through \" _All\nthat you 've done for me\/ Means the world to me_.\" Repetition means that a\nresounding pace is set - and it sure is powerful.\n\nA sonic shift towards the end sees guitar edginess guiding us through the\nchorus in a different light, its closing lines of \" _I know you love it\/ When\nyou come down from above it_ \" and lingering over 'love' given force as\nfollowed with a single drumbeat. A track which tells of the importance of\nappreciating the qualities of thought, connection and love inside a beautiful\npiece of craft.\n\n**The new single from Oddnesse is out now via Make More Records - available to\npurchase on iTunes here.**\n\n**Find Oddnesse on** _Facebook_ **and** _Twitter_ **.**\n\n","date_published":"2018-05-01T17:44:51.000Z","dek":null,"direction":"ltr","domain":"bittersweetsymphonies.co.uk","excerpt":"Oddnesse is an artist capable of weaving worlds of thought and potential inside her tunes \u2013 and her latest single \u2018Trust\u2019 certainly does not disappoint.

The\nnew song is titled 'Night Owl' and after speaking with the Danish producer he\nexplained to me exactly what he was feeling when he was creating this track.\n\n\"When I was working on the track I had this environment in my head. I wanted\nto create the sound of desolate streets on a weekday night. I mean 4 am no\npeople just sodium lamps and dim lights emitting from a few windows. At the\nsame time the Night Owl is me, because that's how I've been living in the last\nyear, staying up late working on music, not going to bed before I could hear\nthe birds tweeting. But that's just the setting, I feel like the vocals and\nprogression of the track can lead to different interpretations so I'll let the\nlistener create a story instead. Maybe you just wanna listen to the music and\nnot think about anything. The vocals I chopped up are by Alina Baraz, and may\nor may not be from a track that isn't released yet\"\n\nGalimatias is easily becoming one of my favorite producers out there. His\nproject with Alina Baraz is getting ready to take the world by storm and I am\nso stoked that I found these two before they become the next big sensation in\ndance music. Imagine a beautiful girl singing on stage while one of the most\ntalented producers in the world is going nuts on live instruments, beat pads\nand all sorts of fun toys. All I can say is that this is a name you NEED to\nremember. Happy hump day everyone <3\n\n","date_published":null,"dek":null,"direction":"ltr","domain":"stoneyroads.com","excerpt":"Galimatias amazes once again with yet another original tune","lang":"en","lead_image_url":"http:\/\/stoneyroads.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/08\/artworks-000088633861-ygezqj-t500x500.jpg","next_page_url":null,"pages_rendered":null,"rendered_pages":1.0,"title":"Galimatias \u2013 Night Owl","total_pages":1.0,"url":"http:\/\/stoneyroads.com\/2014\/08\/galimatias-night-owl-2\/","word_count":306},{"author":"Brooke Ferguson","content":"A little over a week ago, Denmark native, Galimatias sent the internet down to\nthe very depths of the ocean floor with his stunning track, \"Ocean Floor\nKisses.\" We definitely felt as if we were caressing each and every groove\nfound in the elusive abyss beneath us after subjecting our ears to such\nbeauty.

This podcast features exclusive KEXP in-\nstudio performances, unreleased songs, and recordings from independent artists\nthat our DJs think you should hear. Today's song, featured on The Morning Show\nwith John Richards, is \"Edge of Town\" by **Middle Kids** , a 2016 single on\nMMG Records.\n\n**Middle Kids - Edge of Town (MP3)**\n\nMiddle Child Syndrome leaves a middle child feeling left out and invisible in\nbetween the firsts the first-born will accomplish, and the spoiling the baby\nof the family will receive. Although this is the case for many groups of\nthree, Sydney's Middle Kids definitely won't be feeling left out of anything\nmusic-related anytime soon. With only two singles out, the buzz is only\ngrowing around the Australian trio consisting of Hannah Joy, Tim Fitz, and\nHarry Day.\n\n\"Edge of Town\" is the group's debut single. Lead vocalist Hannah Joy's vocals\nare immediately captivating on the track, and only continue build in intensity\nas the track goes on. Combined with airy, piercing guitars, Middle Kids create\nwave after wave of emotion that ripples throughout the entire track. The song\nitself explores the feeling of thinking you're in control of everything, and\nthen realizing you aren't when something like the Earth swallowing you whole\nhappens. The angst and frustration of having no control can be felt at times,\nwhile there is also a sense of optimism and comfort that comes from embracing\nthe unknown.\n\nIf you're looking for more Middle Kids, you won't find them in America anytime\nsoon as of right now. After playing LA and NY a few days ago, they're back\nplaying a few shows in Australia later this month. If you need a quick fix,\ncheck out their other single \"Your Love\", which is equally as intoxicating.\nAlso, be sure to keep up with their Facebook page for future dates and watch\nthe video for \"Edge of Town\" below.\n\nThis entry was posted in KEXP, Song of the Day Podcast and tagged Middle Kids.\nBookmark the permalink.

It opens to this sort\nof saccharine sweet, jewelry box ballerina wind-up-style riff played out over\nvaguely tropical synths but it's hard to tell because everything is just so\nmellow, so fuzzy, so out of focus. American singer-songwriter Baraz doesn't\nhelp the cause too much, skating over the sugary soundscape with breathy\nvocals so dainty it's hard to tell whether they are just another layer of\nsynths or not. When I heard Janet Jackson had reprised her role as female\nsaviour of the RnB world recently, this was the sort of sound I had in mind:\nwashed out enough that you are not particularly aware of the lack of substance\nbeneath. That return sounds more like this, not altogether removed from the\nnotion. If not Janet, then, it had all the hallmarks of a later cut off a\nfaded contemporary star's new record: Ciara's Track 12; Mariah's bonus track.\n\nGalimatias is a Danish producer who has been kicking it for a few years now,\nreleasing instrumentals and more complete tracks and cultivating an audience\norganically. What he was missing all these years, it seems, was an injection\nof 21-year-old, good looking (image so far not associated with the project),\nLA-based vocalist growth hormones. The resulting collaboration occurred in the\nFrankensteinian way you might expect with two individuals living on different\ncontinents - the two didn't meet in real life until February this year, well\nafter their ultimate creation, debut eight-track EP 'Urban Flora', was\nreleased. I think in a way what you hear at the beginning of 'Fantasy' is a\nbreakdown in communication across the Atlantic, a demonstration of how even\nthe best laid plans, when necessarily cross-continental, are fallible.\n\nWhat follows a notably unnotable start is a considerably more assured track\nthat, despite the tepid opening or perhaps because of it, is a triumph of hip-\nhop informing tropical EDM. It's at 1'20\" as the beat kicks into swing, a yelp\nof 'What!?' rings out and some chopped and screwed vocal effects make\nthemselves felt that the true genius of this collaboration is borne out. To be\nsure, Alina retains her cutesy quality throughout, but it is Galimatias' keen\nawareness of how to use it to optimal effect, encased in what transforms into\na lush beat framed by impact strings, that stays with you. With nary a press\nphoto to their name, I've used the cover art from the EP for the moment. In\nthe world of low-key electronic music, cover art is usually predictable,\nrarely inspired. There's something about the juxtaposition not only in the EP\ntitle but in the artwork itself that seems just right for this collaboration.\nEqual parts grit and fairy floss, paradise and lost.\n\n**Alina Baraz & Galimatias - Fantasy**  \nhttp:\/\/www.1songday.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/06\/Alina-Baraz-x-Galimatias-\nFantasy-mp3clan.com_.mp3\n\n","date_published":null,"dek":null,"direction":"ltr","domain":"www.1songday.com","excerpt":"Jun 29th, 2015 | posted by: David | There is a lot, up front, not to like about \u2018Fantasy\u2019.

I'm not quite at that point in my life yet.\n\nBaraz is only 21-years old and is definitely one to keep an eye out for. While\nGalimatia's beats are comparable to those of maybe **Flume** or **Fantastic Mr\nFox** , I haven't yet been able to find match-ups for Baraz's voice. Maybe\nthat's why I've been so hooked.\n\nGive it a listen.\n\n### Related Posts\n\n","date_published":"2015-06-08T16:37:56.000Z","dek":null,"direction":"ltr","domain":"indiemusicfilter.com","excerpt":"Catchy beats, a tropical feel, and unique vocals, all in one.","lang":"en","lead_image_url":"https:\/\/indiemusicfilter.com\/images\/alina-baraz.jpg","next_page_url":null,"pages_rendered":null,"rendered_pages":1.0,"title":"\"Fantasy\" by Alina Baraz & Galimatias","total_pages":1.0,"url":"https:\/\/indiemusicfilter.com\/fantasy-alina-baraz","word_count":119},{"author":"Ivo","content":"Electronic\n\nOhio-based Alina Baraz & the Danish producer Galimatias!\n\nThe #urbanflora \"Fantasy\" is not the first time these two protagonists are\nteaming up together.

Lush vocals intertwined with an 80's strut and\nethereal mystery provides the perfect backing for your favourite film noir\noffering. Drifting into your subconscious, it's a sublime cut of indie chic\nthat demands, and surely deserves, a wider audience. **** __ __ ~~~~\n\n****____~~~~  \n\n  \n**_FRANKIIE Explains:_**  \n**Where was the video for 'Dream Reader' filmed? ** The video was filmed up\npast Pemberton, BC on Anderson Lake. The director had a family cabin up there\nthat is off the grid, so we took a couple days to hang by the lake and shoot\nthe video. Though there wasn't much hanging as it was pretty full on. It was\nNovember, so we were fighting with the light and cold, but it was absolutely\nbeautiful up there.\n\n**How does the video compliment the song?**\n\nThe video is a loop and also a little absurd like a dream. The whole song is\nan excerpt of different dreams put together, and the video has that feel to\nit. Random animals popping out of nowhere, things that don 't totally make\nsense. The general feeling of abstract confusion and the main character\nmaneuvering her way through it all is similar to what the song is about.\nGetting through your dreams at night is similar in some ways to navigating\nyour aspirational dreams during the day. I think that's mainly what the song\nand the video are loosely about.  \n**Any behind the scenes stories?** Yes, the lead actors Britt Ervin and Chris\nBoni were recently engaged a few months prior to this shoot. They hadn 't got\na ring yet, so the first time we shot the scene where the Zebra mask is\nrevealed in the living room, Chris had put the ring in there instead of the\nmask. When he revealed it to her in the shoot we caught her whole beautiful\nreaction on film. It was a tear-jerker and fun moment. They are the coolest\npair - we were so stoked to be working with them, and have since become good\nfriends.\n\n**Tell us about the ideas\/ themes\/ imagery used?**\n\nIn general the theme is mostly about dreams. All kinds of dreams! And we\nwanted the video to feel like it could be one of those wild rides you end up\nin when you 're sleeping. It is also a loop since in the beginning she doesn't\nrealize she is seeing herself as the zebra. When at the end she finds the\nbanana on the ground and realizes she was the zebra all along, she can go back\nand take control of the situation. It's not suppose to make perfect sense, and\ncan be interpreted in many different ways.\n\n**What is the message you hope people take from watching the video?**\n\nWe don 't really have a message we want people to take from this video. It is\nabstract so that people can interpret it how they want. Between the banana\ngun, the zebra and the boxing glove gorilla we felt like it was a good time no\nmatter how people see it.\n\nFeature by DS_Convertible\n\n","date_published":null,"dek":null,"direction":"ltr","domain":"www.whenthehornblows.com","excerpt":"When The Horn Blows | Live Music | Reviews| Interviews | Features","lang":"en","lead_image_url":"https:\/\/2.bp.blogspot.com\/-S-Qp-FtFMcQ\/Wvta6stS9DI\/AAAAAAAAIac\/kPIgydIbzCgntQjVS351NAcPQGlfexThgCLcBGAs\/w1200-h630-p-k-no-nu\/photo%2Bby%2B%2540ldzbar.jpg","next_page_url":null,"pages_rendered":null,"rendered_pages":1.0,"title":"The Band Explains: FRANKIIE - 'Dream Reader'","total_pages":1.0,"url":"http:\/\/www.whenthehornblows.com\/2018\/05\/the-band-explains-frankiie-dream-reader.html","word_count":555},{"author":"Axel Franz\u00e9n","content":"**FRANKIIE** fick en del uppm arksamhet i form av den inbjudande, alternativa\npoplaten _**Glory Me**_ tidigare i  ar.

His earliest output fell into the Jose Gonzalez camp of soft-voiced,\nwarm-bodied pop, while his more recent tracks suggest Belle & Sebastian at\ntheir most electronic. Whatever mode he's writing in, his hooks stand out the\nmost: deft, vaulting melodies that grip the ear without breaking the spell\ncast by his delicate instrumentation. On his latest song, \"Edison,\" Westerman\nswirls together thin, warped guitar chords with lo-fi drums and quirky\nkeyboard riffs, supplying a playful base for his self-effacing lyrics.\n\nLike his recent single, \"Confirmation,\" \"Edison\" seems to grapple with the\nprecarity of creative labor, the rituals and discipline needed to grow a rough\ndraft into a finished product. \"These lightbulb moments rarely come your way,\"\nhe laments in the track's first lines. It's a self-doubt that takes a quasi-\ncomic turn. \"I read Baldwin every morning\/At least I pretend to\/Isn't that the\nsame?\" Westerman repeats at the song's breakdown, harmonizing with himself\nacross sheets of reverb. A lightweight take on artistic insecurity, \"Edison\"\ndeflates the myth that any kind of endeavor comes naturally. You've got to\nwork for it, and if that fails, you've at least got to pretend to work for it.\n\n","date_published":null,"dek":null,"direction":"ltr","domain":"pitchfork.com","excerpt":"The London songwriter Westerman brings a gentle touch to his music","lang":"en","lead_image_url":"https:\/\/media.pitchfork.com\/photos\/5af48ea102ed064cdab620d4\/1:1\/w_500\/westerman%20edison%20single%20art.jpg","next_page_url":null,"pages_rendered":null,"rendered_pages":1.0,"title":"Listen to \u201cEdison\u201d by Westerman","total_pages":1.0,"url":"https:\/\/pitchfork.com\/reviews\/tracks\/westerman-edison\/","word_count":218},{"author":null,"content":"Following up to his double single \"Confirmation\" and \"I Turned Away,\" London's\nalternative pop singer-songwriter _Westerman_ is back with  \"Edison,\" which\nwas also produced by electronic artist _Bullion_.\n\nAbout \"Edison,\" _Westerman_ detailed:\n\nThings are going pretty well for the artist since the release of his debut\n\"Harvard EP\" back in 2016.

Once its sinuous melody had fully lodged itself into\nour minds, we named Westerman an Artist To Watch. \"I Turned Away,\" the B-side\nto \"Confirmation,\" ranked amongst our favorite songs that same week.\n\n\"I Turned Away,\" however, was still a B-side -- and after something on the\nlevel of \"Confirmation,\" you're left waiting and wondering what will come\nnext. Today, that wait is over with the release of Westerman's new single\n\"Edison.\" Like \"Confirmation\" turned a musing on the elusive creative process\ninto a relatable tale of stagnation vs. self-actualization, \"Edison\" grapples\nwith the concept of ambition in a specific context that still might hit home.\n\n\"I was day-dreaming and imagining what it would be like to be inside the head\nof a megalomaniac,\" Westerman said of the song. \"I enjoyed playing around with\nall of the secret neuroses that might reside there, all the unmet needs and\nfear.\" If \"Edison\" is a character sketch of sorts, it features a couple\ncutting, amusing descriptions: \"I read Baldwin\/ Every morning\/ At least I\npretend to\/ Isn't that the same?\" Westerman sings at one point.\n\n\"Edison\" exists in a similar atmospheric space to \"Confirmation.\" Westerman\nbends his voice into unpredictable directions, sounding like a glistening\ntendril of cigarette smoke hovering over the sheen of the song's\ninstrumentation and its simple, persistent beat.

This time up we're dishing\nthree covers of Talking Heads' \"This Must Be The Place (Naive Melody).\"\n\nIf you're new here then let me lay out how this works. For this series, which\nwe've been doing infrequently for a little over five years now, I dig up three\ndifferent covers of a beloved song and serve them up for your enjoyment.\nEmphasis on \"different\" because part of the fun is showcasing how artists\nthat, in theory, are very different nonetheless share the same influences.\nWe've done Served Three Ways for songs by Father John Misty, Drake, Oasis, and\nmore.\n\nAs I mentioned above, we've lined up three pretty slick covers of Talking\nHeads' \"This Must Be The Place (Naive Melody)\" this time around. The original\ntune was released in 1983 on Talking Heads' _Speaking in Tongues_. It 's a\nsong that David Byrne has described as a long song:\n\n\"That's a love song made up almost completely of non sequiturs, phrases that\nmay have a strong emotional resonance but don't have any narrative qualities.\nIt's a real honest kind of love song. I don't think I've ever done a real love\nsong before. Mine always had a sort of reservation, or a twist. I tried to\nwrite one that wasn't corny, that didn't sound stupid or lame the way many do.\nI think I succeeded; I was pretty happy with that.\"\n\nWe have three studio recorded versions of the tune including a somewhat\norchestral take on the tune by Kishi Bashi; a shuffling, playful version by\nSure Sure; and a sweeping, pensive version by The Lumineers.\n\nAnd, if you're looking for _even more_ Naive Melody you can check out a few\nlive versions of the tune by Car Seat Headrest  & Naked Giants (a personal\nfavorite), Arcade Fire, Iron & Wine, and MGMT. Honestly, some many people have\ntackled this tune that this collection just scratches the surface.

After her popular\ndance videos were passed around Donald Glover's team, they brought her in to\nprovide contrast and add a sense of light to the video's heavy political\nthemes. \"There are a lot of dark themes in it, so they wanted us to be the\nlight of the video,\" Silver says. \"You know how kids are innocent and kind of\nunaware of what's going on? We were there to smile and bring joy to everyone\nwatching it, because the background is bringing so much darkness and reality.\"\n\nSilver says her goal is to \"take Afro dance and Afro culture to the world and\nthen take the world to Africa,\" and this video gave her the platform to do\nthat. Plus, the concept fit perfectly with her own background. \"Dance is\neverything to us,\" she explains. \"No matter how much is going on--even if it's\nthe middle of a war or poverty or hunger--one thing Africans share is we dance\nour sorrows away. Not even professionally, it's just a part of our culture.\n\nIncorporating moves that range from South Africa's Gwara Gwara dance to\nBlocBoy JB's shoot dance, the video is full of symbolic references from all\nover the world. \"The whole point is to get a discussion going and to get\npeople coming up with their own opinions,\" Silver notes. \"We tried to show\nwhat's actually happening in the world. Not just in America, but in the world.\nWe also wanted to bring joy to it, in the middle of madness. That's what kids\ndo and that's what dance does--especially African dance.\"\n\nContinue for our full conversation with Sherrie Silver and learn more about\nthe meaning behind her choreography. You can watch Gambino's \"This Is America\"\nvideo below (directed by Hiro Murai and produced by Doomsday with Ibra Ake and\nFam Rothstein of Wolf + Rothstein).\n\n**How did you get started with dance and choreography?**\n\nThis is going to sound funny, but I used to write songs for my country and one\nday I was given the opportunity to perform for the president of Rwanda. Then\nthey recommended me for a film role, so I went into acting. I did a movie and\na few other things, before going to university. At that point, I had to decide\nif I was going to continue acting or finish and graduate. I decided to stay in\nschool, but I thought, 'What else could I do while I'm here?' So I was like,\n'I can kind of dance, I guess.' Instead of just doing what everyone else was\ndoing, I wanted to embrace my culture, which I love so much.\n\n> if anyone is working with me or they're supporting my work, they're also\nsupporting the actual African community and the development of the continent\nand its people.\n\n**It looks like you have big goals that extend beyond dance. On yourwebsite,\nyou say \"I'm on a mission to educate the world about African culture.\" How\ndoes dance help you achieve those goals?**\n\nMy little slogan is that I take Afro dance and Afro culture to the world and\nthen take the world to Africa. So I do that with the dance videos. Even what\njust happened now with Donald, our moves are on a world platform, and it opens\nall these doors. One of the main moves is a South African move. People want to\nknow more about South Africa. People want to know more about our culture.\n\nThen I go back to places like Rwanda, Nigeria, or Uganda and I'll open up\nthese projects. I'll help set up businesses for people. I opened a vocational\ntraining center for ex-drug addicts and sex workers. I've helped redevelop\nschools. My most recent and biggest project at the moment is I'm on a mission\nto take homeless kids off the street, so I opened a home for homeless children\nin Rwanda. Then next week I'm going back to celebrate by having a party with\nhomeless, underprivileged, and disabled children in the capital city.\nBasically, if anyone is working with me or they're supporting my work, they're\nalso supporting the actual African community and the development of the\ncontinent and its people.\n\n**How did you get connected with Donald Glover and his team for \"This Is\nAmerica?\"**\n\nI believe it was because of one of the little nieces or cousins of someone on\nhis management team. Apparently she was, like, obsessed with me and she used\nto watch my videos. She showed the videos to one of them, and when the project\ncame up, they thought I would be perfect to choreograph and portray the\nhappiness that they needed with the happy African school children. Me, working\nwith kids, it was just perfect. I knew exactly how to go about it, because I\ngrew up out in Rwanda. Then I moved to England, but I went back again. So I\nknow how we are in school. I know that dance is everything to us. No matter\nhow much is going on--even if it's the middle of a war or poverty or hunger--\none thing Africans share is we dance our sorrows away. Not even\nprofessionally, it's just a part of our culture.\n\nImage via YouTube\n\n**Do you remember the initial direction that Donald Glover 's team gave you?**\n\nThere are a lot of dark themes in it, so they wanted us to be the light of the\nvideo. You know how kids are innocent and kind of unaware of what's going on?\nWe were there to smile and bring joy to everyone watching it, because the\nbackground is bringing so much darkness and reality. I've seen a lot of people\nonline referring to us as \"the distraction,\" which I find quite interesting.\nThat's why I loved being a part of this particular project, because a lot of\npeople comment, \"Completely ignore the dancers and Donald and watch what's in\nthe background.\" You know, there are two completely different worlds in one\nscene. Or, three different worlds actually. It's amazing.\n\n**Yeah, fans have already been drawing all kinds of conclusions. I even saw\ntheories about _Clockwork Orange_ references. What has it been like seeing\npeople interpret the video and choreography in so many different ways\nalready?**\n\nThat's the whole point. The whole point is to get a discussion going and to\nget people coming up with their own opinions. Even with me being a part of the\ncreative team, when I was watching the end of the video where Donald was\nrunning, I still don't know what he's running from. This is his vision. I was\nthere to help put it together and add the dance elements, but Donald is the\none who knows all the storyline--if there is a storyline. But what I do know\nis that we're trying to show what's actually happening in the world. Not just\nin America, but in the world. We also wanted to bring joy to it, in the middle\nof madness. That's what kids do and that's what dance does--especially African\ndance.\n\n> I was just happy to choreograph something from my heart that would portray\nDonald's vision.\n\n**How collaborative was the whole process?**\n\nWorking with Donald was great, because he knew exactly what he wanted. He\nwould let me know what he wants and I would come up with something, then we'd\ndo the rehearsals. Obviously the video isn't very straightforward. It's a very\ndifficult concept to understand. So Donald, the director Hiro Murai, and I had\nto work very closely together.\n\nYou know, everything is quite loose and it didn't have to be _too _\nchoreographed. You know how in a lot of music videos, the dancing is super\nserious? In this case, everything is really loose. It's almost a bit funny.\nAnd Donald knew exactly what he wanted. I was just happy to choreograph\nsomething from my heart that would portray Donald's vision.\n\n**Donald Glover is known for having a lot of different talents, but he 's not\na professional dancer. What was it like working with him as a choreographer?**\n\nIt was actually great. They're not easy moves. They might look simple in the\nvideo, but there's a lot of technicality to them. A lot of these moves come\nfrom the heart. One thing I noticed was he was so dedicated to making sure he\ngot it right. He got videos of the dances, went home and watched them, then\nliterally came back the next day with the dances down. I remember seeing him\nrehearsing the hardest move. It was amazing. He was very, very dedicated. I'm\njust so happy with the final product and his style of movement, because I know\nthat no one has seen him dance in that particular way before. He has his own\ntwist.\n\nImage via YouTube\n\n**You mentioned earlier that one of the dances was a South African dance. Was\nthat the ****Gwara** ** Gwara dance?**\n\nYeah, that was one of the main ones. The one guideline he gave me was the\nGwara Gwara dance. He really likes that dance. It's the trending dance right\nnow as well. So I had to make sure I got all the dances and did them properly,\nbecause I knew everyone would be watching this and I had to get it right.\n\n**One of my favorite things about this video is that it combines dances from\nall over. There are African dances right next to the shoot dance, the Nae Nae\nand all these other recognizable dances.**\n\nYeah, there was the shoot dance, and I think I put a reverse in there and a\nsmall Nae Nae in the _SNL_ performance. This is an unfamiliar style that\npeople are still catching up with, so I wanted to add something a bit\nrelatable, so you can recognize something. Like,  \"Oh, look, they're doing the\nshoot, I can do that, too!\" So now people have started doing a dance\nchallenge, where they're trying something new, but they still have something\nthat's a bit comfortable. Obviously the song is called \"This Is America,\" so\neven though I'm contrasting it with African dance, I still wanted to include\nsome American dance styles in there, too.\n\n**What were some other dances that you included?**\n\nThere's the Shaku Shaku dance from Nigeria. That's another big dance right\nnow. We had so many. We had a lot of dances from Angola. We had the Alkayida,\nwhich is from Ghana. There was a little bit of the Azonto in there as well,\nwhich is from Ghana. And a lot of them don't have names, too. I didn't want to\nput in moves just from Rwanda because I'm from there. I lived in South Africa\nfor some months, I've been to Nigeria many times and have projects out there.\nUganda, too. I wanted to include dances from different parts of Africa, so I\ncould represent a lot of the continent.\n\n> There were over 100 people on set, but everyone just worked together to make\nsure the project came together beautifully.\n\n**Technically, this looks like it would be a difficult video to pull off. A\nlot of the shots are really long and there 's so much going on in the\nbackground with extra dancers and everything. Was that a challenge?**\n\nI think they brought together the best for this video. The director Hiro Murai\nis one of the best. The whole team was great. Having a great team of people\nwho know exactly what they're doing just makes life easier. The extras were\ndoing their job very well, the horse was being obedient... [Laughs]. It was\nactually a very smooth shoot. You would think it would be very chaotic. But\nyou know, there's a scene where everything stops and Donald starts smoking.\nEven with that, that was literally how quiet it was. There were over 100\npeople on set, but everyone just worked together to make sure the project came\ntogether beautifully. We only shot it over two days.\n\n**Some of the more obvious symbols are the allusions to Jim Crow in the\nbeginning and the church shooting. Where did those ideas come from?**\n\nYeah, the pose that he used in the beginning that everyone is referring to\nwith Jim Crow--that was Donald's idea. I was actually surprised when the video\ncame out. I had seen it before, but I'm not sure if he did get the inspiration\nfrom Jim Crow or not. I don't know if he did or if it was a coincidence.\nBecause for me, I just noticed, \"Wow, you're shooting this guy really\npassionately.\" It was an amazing posture to shoot somebody, you know? So I'm\nnot sure, that's a question for Donald.\n\nImage via YouTube\n\n**Do you usually try to work a lot of symbolism into your choreography?**\n\nSometimes I definitely do. I think it's important to add elements that the\naudience can relate to, especially with history. I think it just makes you a\nbetter choreographer if you can reference or pay homage to historical figures.\n\n**The political themes and messages of this song could have been conveyed in a\nlot of different ways, visually. What about dance choreography, specifically,\ndo you think suited the themes of this video so well? **\n\nI think the dance part of it really took the video to a different level. We're\nso used to seeing someone getting shot, someone making money, someone smoking\n--we're used to seeing all of that. But we wanted to show a light within all\nthe political issues that are going on. And also the contrast of it being\nAfrican kids in America at a time like this. We were almost misplaced and we\nwere happy in the video. I think it's just beautiful. It's an amazing concept.\nI love it.\n\n**You make a cameo as a dancer in this, too, right?**\n\nYeah, I'm in all the dance scenes with the dancers. So in the opening scene\nwhen he's walking forward, we come in and it's almost like he doesn't even\nknow we're there. We're like his shadow. That was the word that was used.\nWe're basically his shadow, but not doing exactly what he's doing--kind of\nmimicking him. Then we come back in again later. We're always kind of his\nshadow, so it gives people room to come up with a message from that as well.\nLike, why are these kids his shadow? There are so many conclusions that can be\ndrawn from that.\n\n> we wanted to show a light within all the political issues that are going on.\n\n**What was your favorite part about the choreography in this video?**\n\nI really loved the bit where it says \"Hunnid bands, hunnid bands, hunnid\nbands,\" and we were all going around him. It's a move from the Ivory Coast.\nIt's a particular way of walking. How we deserted him, that was something I\nreally wanted, just to add to the drama. When does your shadow ever desert\nyou? It's almost like he noticed everyone was gone, then he goes back into his\nown world.\n\n**The conclusion that I 've seen a lot of people draw is that Gambino's\ndancing is meant to distract from all the craziness happening around him. Do\nyou agree?**\n\nYou could say \"distract,\" but I say \"contrast.\"\n\n**You called it \"the light,\" earlier, which I thought was a good way of\nputting it.**\n\nYeah, because no matter what, kids are always innocent. But what was\ninteresting as well was that we didn't get hurt. We weren't affected by what\nwas going on. But don't forget that one of the kids--the dancers--was actually\nthe gun holder, as well.\n\n**You also did the choreography for the _Saturday Night Live_ performance. How\n'd you approach that?**\n\nI wanted to have the same approach as the video with divided worlds. That's\nwhy we had Donald and the kids on two different sides and then they finally\ncame together as one--which is similar as the video. He wasn't moving a lot,\nbut the kids were really hyper, so there was less dancing for him on _SNL_.\nBut the most important thing was the lights and having that climax with the\nlights. That was the joyful moment. With _SNL_ , we added the money circle\nwhere the kids were dancing and throwing money.

It is to note\nthat in his direct bloodline is 14th century poet John Gower and George\nFrederick Root, the most popular songwriter of the Civil War era. So it's no\nwonder he's got so much talent to share with us. He really knows how to weave\nstories into his songwriting, and we're infinitely thankful that he utilizes\nhis full vocabulary to do so. (Seriously. It's amazing.) Everything about this\nman is poetic. (Again, look at the photo above.) We've got his track \"Real\nPeach\" right here for you to enjoy.\n\nHave you ever heard a beginning to a song so delicate and beautiful? The\nmelody made my lips curl up just slightly, trying not to smile at the\nundeniable beauty of this composition. Henry's voice is folksy and light,\nmaking the song feel crisp and close. It's absolutely a love song and it might\nbe a good idea to sing it to your significant other when you're fighting.\n(It'll will totally break up the clouds that drive your bad mood.)\n\n**Tell me about yourself.**\n\nI'm a musician from Vermont, with an EP coming out in October. I'm interested\nin synthesizing my interest in philosophy and poetry and my feelings about my\nrelationships into songs. Or I might just say that that's what ends up\nhappening and I'm interested in the fact that it happens.\n\n**What 's the story behind your song \"Real Peach?\"**\n\nThere's a line in the movie _The Rules of the Game_ by Jean Renoir, which is\nsomething like: \"I want to disappear down a hole. The awful truth about life\nis that everybody has their reasons.\" That's what I was getting at in this\nsong, though without seeing it as an awful thing, but as a good reason to stop\nfighting. It's about coming out the other side of a disagreement with a newly\ngenerous attitude and about a person who helped me to do that.\n\n**What was the process behind producing the track?**\n\nI demoed it first on my 8-track, in a classroom after my shift at a summer\ncamp. I didn't have all the lyrics, so I just kind of garbled some stuff,\nwhich ended up sounding like words that I ended up using. Then I tracked it\nall with my engineer, Ethan West, in his studio in Goshen, VT. We had tracked\nseven songs by then, so we had all of our sounds figured out, but the banjo\nwas a late addition.\n\n**Tell me about your upcoming EP, The Rains.**\n\nIt's a collection of mostly love songs, which went through at least a few\nversions each before they reached this stage. It took a pretty long time to\nsettle on a sound and I'm proud of it.\n\n**What are you most excited for after the EP comes out?**\n\nI'm excited to see old musician friends and to make new ones. I'm excited to\nsee the world (hopefully Europe sometime) and to start recording the next\nthing. I'm most happy to be getting some clarity around my purpose in life,\nwhich sounds heavy, but that's what it is.\n\n**What is something you think everyone needs to know about you or your\nmusic?**\n\nWell, just that if you like my music then keep checking in on it, because I\nhave some tricks up my sleeve.\n\n**Who 's your favorite superhero?**\n\nI saw the first Iron Man when it came out and I hated it, but then I kept\ngoing and I really liked The Avengers movies and whenever Iron Man shows up in\nthem I realize that I actually like him a lot.\n\n**What 's up next for you?**\n\nI'm doing a tiny tour with my friend Jeff Beam and then I'm working on a farm\nfor a few weeks to get some cash before I go into more touring and recording.\nI'm also moving in with my parents for a little while\u2026\n\n","date_published":"2016-08-29T11:16:21.000Z","dek":null,"direction":"ltr","domain":"www.imposemagazine.com","excerpt":"Burlington, Vermont\u2019s Henry Jamison comes from a poetic family.

To the complete opposite,\nin which there there is no basic state of being, because we've skipped the\nanalogue - so to speak - and jumped straight to the digital. See, I'm mixing\nmetaphors!\n\n**3\\. How has your work evolved over the past few years since you started\nreleasing music?**\n\nNot enough! I feel like I'm still scratching the surface to be honest. I think\nI've become more surgical as to how I produce music, but am still working off\nof the same creative and intellectual repertoire in a way. Not that the ideas\nare the same, I have a new idea for a song almost every day, it's just that\nthe ground on which they grow hasn't changed much. I think I execute these\nideas in a more direct way now than I used to though\u2026 just more focused on the\nbasics like melody and lyrics, and trying to stay in touch with the listener\nmore as a singer - I suppose I've been  trying to create more intimacy in\ngeneral.\n\n**4\\. Will you be releasing more music soon?**\n\nDefinitely! I'm never gonna take that long a hiatus again.. or at least not\nanytime soon. I've just finished producing my second EP - so stay tuned for\nmore releases this summer and fall :)\n\n**5\\. When can your fans expect to see you live again? **\n\nNo specific dates lined up just yet, but hopefully very soon\u2026 I have a bunch\nof new songs, so there's quite some rehearsing to do first. I'm sure we'll be\nplaying a bunch in the NYC area over the next couple of months though.\n\n#### **Governors Ball Presents: Pond on 5\/30 @ Warsaw**\n\n####\n\n","date_published":"2018-05-12T15:31:17.000Z","dek":null,"direction":"ltr","domain":"www.audiofemme.com","excerpt":"1.

It's an odd expression, suggesting that an artist only has one sound\nand it's somehow hidden waiting to be discovered. Can you imagine David Bowie\nbeing told when he was just starting out that he wasn't ready to be signed\nbecause he hadn't 'found his sound.' If that was the case then he spent the\nwhole of his career constantly trying to find that sound, as his musical style\nwas forever evolving. I think often the expression actually just means\nsomething else: 'What you are doing doesn't match with what I'm looking for.'  \n  \nIf artists did just did have one sound their art would very quickly become\nboring - an endless succession of repeats. I touched on this in my previous\npost regarding the new Jungle material and that of their two new songs. _Happy\nMan_ , whilst well written, felt somewhat disappointing, being essentially not\nthat different to songs on their first record, whereas _House in LA_ felt more\nexciting due to its progression stylistically  - whilst still being\nrecognisably a Jungle song.  \n  \nWhich brings me to Laurel, another artist that the 'finding her sound'\ndescription could be used to describe. Or maybe Laurel is just another artist,\nlike Bowie, who likes to try different things and evolve. Maybe she's not\ntrying to find anything except good tunes? Having first appeared as a folky\nLaura Marling inspired songwriter under the name Under The Laurels, she\nmorphed into a balladeer of beauty - Britain's answer to Lana Del Rey, then\nhad a go at edgy pop before moving to something less processed, more stripped\nback and guitar based.  \n  \nAnd as Laurel has woven her way through these different musical shapes and\nforms there has always been the question of when is there going to be an\nalbum? She hinted in interviews from last year that it would drop in 2017 but\nthat didn't happen. However finally in 2018 there is confirmation of a long\nplayer, titled _Dogviolet_ , which will be released on the 24th August 2017\nvia Counter Records. There will also be an 11 date UK tour to support the\nrecord and this, a new single called _Lovesick_.  \n  \n_Lovesick_ keeps things raw musically and finds Laurel opening up her heart.\nShe sings of obsession and addiction to a relationship, for better or for\nworse. She calls it love.  \"You'd be a love song, baby I'm lovesick, tasted\nthe devil, now I can't be apart from you.\" The track reminds me a little of\nsome of Nilufer Yanya's recent output - managing to combine a certain\neffortlessness with an urgent passion that bodes well for the album when it\narrives. Take a listen below.  \n  \n**Laurel - Lovesick **  \n\n","date_published":"2018-06-05T22:45:00.000Z","dek":null,"direction":"ltr","domain":"breakingmorewaves.blogspot.com","excerpt":"One of the things that unsigned artists sometimes tell me is that, when speaking to record labels and in particular major labels, the A&R...","lang":"en","lead_image_url":"https:\/\/4.bp.blogspot.com\/-P1eZdcHkOao\/WvNm6y2pCgI\/AAAAAAAARSo\/XI9EngfRPZEb03ZH5FGwtxLG0SMXmxlsQCLcBGAs\/w1200-h630-p-k-no-nu\/classic%2Blaurel.jpg","next_page_url":null,"pages_rendered":null,"rendered_pages":1.0,"title":"New Music: Laurel - Lovesick","total_pages":1.0,"url":"http:\/\/breakingmorewaves.blogspot.com\/2018\/05\/new-music-laurel-lovesick.html","word_count":490},{"author":null,"content":"East London-based singer\/Songwriter **LAUREL** just announced the release of\nher long awaited debut album ' **DOGVIOLET** ' on **August 24, 2018** via\nCounter Records.\n\n**LAUREL** wrote and recorded the 12 track long player in her home studio,\nthen took it to Gizzard Studios to feed the songs back through a reel-to-reel\ntape recorder, re-capturing the organic tone that is prevalent within her\nbreathtaking live shows.\n\n  \n\n____\n\n","date_published":"2018-05-09T14:35:40.000Z","dek":null,"direction":"ltr","domain":"www.localsuicide.com","excerpt":"East London-based singer\/Songwriter LAUREL just announced the release of her long awaited debut album \u2018DOGVIOLET\u2018 on August 24, 2018 via","lang":"en","lead_image_url":"http:\/\/www.localsuicide.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/05\/Screen-Shot-2018-05-28-at-17.45.23-296x197.png","next_page_url":null,"pages_rendered":null,"rendered_pages":1.0,"title":"New Music: Laurel \u2013 Lovesick","total_pages":1.0,"url":"http:\/\/www.localsuicide.com\/new-music-laurel-lovesick\/","word_count":66},{"author":"Cerys\nKenneally","content":"London's Laurel captured listeners with her soothing, powerful vocals.\nManaging to maintain a strong sound without major instrumental domination,\nLaurel reflects with emotion on her new offering.\n\n\"Lovesick\", taken from Laurel's upcoming debut album _DOGVIOLET_ , sees the\nyoung Londoner trail delicately through tough realisations, while still\nfinding a strong enough sound to showcase the powerful undertones in her\nvocals.\n\nSpeaking about the track, Laurel explains, \"I wrote these songs at home often\nlocking myself away for periods of time in order to capture the true mania\nthat comes from love; although a beautiful feeling, it can often feel a lot\nuglier.\"\n\nBeing the first release from her debut _DOGVIOLET_ , \"Lovesick\" is an honest,\nyet almost nail-biting glimpse into the intimate simplicity of Laurel's sound.\n\n##### \"Lovesick\" is the first track to be lifted from Laurel's debut album\n_DOGVIOLET_ , out 24 August via Counter Records.

The latest track carrying this _modus\noperandi_ is  \"The Hype,\" the band's first song since the 2015 album _Why\nChoose_.\n\nShopping's music is usually brisk, with songs that know not to outstay their\nwelcome. \"The Hype,\" though still groovy, is a little more indulgent than\nusual. Rachel Aggs' guitar lines sound loose and endearingly noodly\nthroughout; she even turns in a rare guitar solo, and later drops out\ncompletely to let Billy Easter and Andrew Milk go into a drum-and-bass\nbreakdown. The result: one of Shopping's loosest, funkiest songs to date.\n\nThe band's lyrics, though, are characteristically spare, even as \"The Hype\"\napproaches a complicated topic. The song, as the band explains to NPR Music,\nis about remaining awake and critical of \"scary populist rhetoric\" within \"the\nincessant echo chamber of ideas that is social media and meme culture.\" As its\nmembers exhort: \"For the record -- ask questions! Don't believe -- ask\nquestions!\" The clipped, blithely chanted phrases of \"The Hype\" recall the\nsloganeering you'd hear at a rally or a clearance sale (\"Last chance!\"), but\nit's all very laconic and hardly moralistic.\n\n\"The Hype\" is a transparently political song for a band that has shied away\nfrom the suggestion that politicizing its music and itself was a deliberate\nsongwriting or _*shudder*_ branding strategy. All labels are limiting in some\nways, and many set suffocating expectations  -- even musicians who write songs\nabout politics and society can be reluctant to wholeheartedly assume the\n\"political\" mantle. Shopping has no problems writing about this political\nmoment, but its members would rather be rated for their music than their\nmessaging. On this front, \"The Hype\" is a great sign of things to come.\n\nShopping _goes_ _on tour_ _in November._\n\n","date_published":"2017-10-05T19:41:00.000Z","dek":null,"direction":"ltr","domain":"www.npr.org","excerpt":"Shopping knows how to check itself, while also giving itself over to the groove. \"The Hype\" is the trio's first song since its 2015 album Why Choose.","lang":"en","lead_image_url":"https:\/\/media.npr.org\/assets\/img\/2017\/10\/03\/shopping_wide-00cc8e41acc520bf71733085eeb10f6378628fa9.jpg?s=1400","next_page_url":null,"pages_rendered":null,"rendered_pages":1.0,"title":"Songs We Love: Shopping, 'The Hype'","total_pages":1.0,"url":"https:\/\/www.npr.org\/2017\/10\/05\/555370825\/songs-we-love-shopping-the-hype","word_count":314},{"author":null,"content":"September 27, 2017\n\nShopping - The Hype - new single with that classic, jaunty postpunk sound\n\n>  _Having spent the past few years touring the UK, EU and US, as well as\nsplitting their time between other creative and musical projects, today post-\npunk trio Shopping return with the bold, spiky new single 'THE HYPE', the\nfirst taste of new music since their acclaimed 2015 album, Why Choose?\nreleased on FatCat Records. _  \n>\n\n","date_published":null,"dek":null,"direction":"ltr","domain":"burlveneer-music.tumblr.com","excerpt":"Shopping - The Hype - new single with that classic, jaunty postpunk sound \u201c Having spent the past few years touring the UK, EU and US, as well as splitting their time between other creative and...","lang":"en","lead_image_url":"https:\/\/78.media.tumblr.com\/tumblr_oww5yhGpE51rrh4sy_1506436649_cover.jpg","next_page_url":null,"pages_rendered":null,"rendered_pages":1.0,"title":"Shopping - The Hype","total_pages":1.0,"url":"http:\/\/burlveneer-music.tumblr.com\/post\/165803702734\/shopping-the-hype-new-single-with-that","word_count":74},{"author":"Riccardo Cavrioli","content":"Attenzione perche la voce dolce e carezzevole di **Tania Yankovska** potrebbe\ngenerare dipendenza immediata, cos i come le sue trame synth-pop ricche di\nmelodia zuccherosa anni '80.\n\nQuesto e il messaggio che troverete sulla pagina Facebook di Hindu: \"Sending\nyou dream vibes\" e noi non possiamo he gioire per il ritorno della fanciulla\nucraina, che ricordavamo con piacere per l'EP \"Spark\", che metteva gia in luce\nun talento in via di costruzione.

Despite the fact that Philly rockers **Hop\nAlong** got a little playful in the revealing of their upcoming new album\n_Bark Your Head Off, Dog_ through mysterious clues left via social media last\nweek, I was still wholly unexpecting to get a taste of it so quickly.  \"How\nSimple\", the album opener and first single from the upcoming album, is a\nquick, uncomplicated reintroduction to songwriter Frances Quinlan and the rest\nof her merry band. Quinlan, despite the immediacy open contained in her\nvocals, has never been a particular straightforward songwriter - preferring\ninstead to have her subjects twist and turn in ways that are much more human\nthan a direct narrative would. \"How Simple\" essentially finds Quinlan\nemploying the same sense of delayed gratification as she subtly reveals the\nsong's core subject: a nervous dategoer. But even though Quinlan prefers to\ngradually reveal a song's twists and turns, she's a little more explicit here.\n\"Pale as a banshee sun - think I should stop checking myself out in the\nwindows of cars when I can see my future in her pictures of relatives\" Quinlan\noffers in a musical stage whisper. It isn't until after the second verse after\nthe abstract chorus that the other shoe drops. \"Don't worry, we will both find\nout just not together\". It's the sort of reveal a songwriter might save until\nthe end of a song but Quinlan offers it up readily and presses onward. \"How\nSimple\" is a song that doesn't ever shift perspective even as it shifts in\ntime and mood. The story has changed but Quinlan's knack for narratives that\nconcern themselves with how one phrase can encapsulate a colossal moment and\nhow a particular character might respond to that is a skill she's deployed\nsince Hop Along's debut. The only difference is, with more songs\/albums under\ntheir belt, it's easy to see the quiet genius in Quinlan's semi stream-of-\nconsciousness songwriting. She offers clues in seemingly off-the-cuff\nstatements are phrases and then after her reveals, moves on, to give power to\nnot the reveal but the aftershock. \"How Simple\" is simple and sweet, a lovely\nexamination of how one's own feelings\/experiences can color a situation or\nshield you from an obvious truth. Nothing's ever simple in matters of the\nheart and Quinlan perfectly captures that both throughout in the song itself\nand in it's somewhat ironic chorus \"How simple the heart can be frightens me\".\n\n_Bark Your Head Off, Dog_ , the third full length album from Hop Along is out\nApril 6th on Saddle Creek.

I'm 21 years old, half greek and half Norwegian,\nand live in Norway. I've been doing music since I was a kid. It started off\nwith piano and vocal lessons, and then I started writing my own music when I\nwas 16. I've always enjoyed listening to people, but never been very good\ntalking about my own feelings. And I'm not a fan of writing a diary either, so\nwriting music is a nice way to get things out.\"\n\n **You 've been releasing music since 2014 and have been bubbling just under\nthe surface in Norway for a while with some great live shows (a couple that\nI've seen)...do you feel that taking things slow, taking some time to find\nyour sound has been the right thing to do?**\n\n\"Glad to hear you liked our shows! Music has always been a huge part of my\nlife and I've never really made the decision that 'music is what I'm gonna\ndo'; music has just always been there, and kind of escalated into what I do\nnow. I like the thought of working at things step-by-step - and not rushing. I\nthink making music and playing shows are the most fun things in the world, and\nthe last thing I would want to happen is to rush into something I'm not\ncomfortable with. I think, as a musician, it's important to take some time and\nfigure out what you really like and what you want to say with your music. So\nyeah, no rushing.\"\n\n **Who and what influences you and your sound?**\n\n\"My everyday life and the people around me. Most of my songs grow out of\neither a story from a friend or something that has happened to me. I have a\nlot of inspiring people around me. Also, I'm a real fan of just observing\npeople. Like everywhere I go. And then I make stories in my head around what I\nsee. When it comes to my sound I grew up with a lot of Greek music. And what I\nlove about the old Greek music is the powerful lyrics and strong melodies that\ndon't need a lot of fuzz around. And I won't say that you necessarily can hear\ngreek vibes in my music, but I always have in mind that less fuzz and more\nfeelings is what I want. Cause that's what it's all about I think - feelings.\"\n\n **What can you tell us about the new single?**\n\n\"The idea of making a song called 'First Impression' had been on my mind for a\nlong time. I've always found it fascinating how we make a picture of someone\nin our heads in a matter of seconds. And at first that was what the song was\nabout. I was playing around on the piano and wrote some lines, but then I\nkinda forgot about it. But then I went to a session with Bergen-based Askjell\nSolstrand (great guy, amazing writer\/producer), and we turned it into a more\nsassy song about meeting someone who seems very charming and fun, but when you\ndig deeper there's nothing more.\"\n\n**You 're from a place called Tennfjord but live in Trondheim, what can you\ntell us about why the city has such a vibrant music scene? Do you have some\nfavourite artists we should watch out for?**\n\n\"Well, before I moved here, I heard things like 'Trondheim is unique' and 'no\ncity is like Trondheim'. And well, Trondheim is the first city I've lived in\nso I don't have a lot to compare with, but shit - Trondheim is amazing. We\nhave the university NTNU, Norway's biggest university, which makes Trondheim a\nstudent city, AKA a city filled with so much creativity, energy and engagement\nI didn't think was possible before I moved here. SO much talent and so many\nhard working people. We also have a lot of arenas for both up and coming and\nmore developed musicians to play gigs, for example we have Trondheim Calling,\nwhich is a great platform for an up-coming-artist to play for the music\nindustry. And we also have Studentersamfundet, which is, well, impossible to\ndescribe, but just an amazing place, driven by volunteer students. I could\nwrite for ages about this city, but I'll stop here.\n\nI listen a lot to Norwegian music, and one of my favourites are Pom Poko (who\nhave roots in Trondheim [\u2764] ), they are awesome. I also love Hajk. Jesus,\nevery single song from their self-titled debut album is great.\"\n\n **What 's the next steps for you? An EP? More single tracks? An album?**\n\n\"There will be more music!

I honestly can't remember the last time I was this\nproductive or capable.\n\nI've been thinking a lot about the idea of\"growing up\" lately. For many, it's\na cynical rejection of our personal passions, infatuations, hobbies and\nidentities for the eventual embracing of 'adult responsibility.' For others,\nit can be the distillation of these things into something we can use to\ninteract with the wider world. Almost like constructing a plaster cast of ones\nown face to then interact with society. The single inevitability is that we\noutgrow the state of adolescence in which our identity is our primary\npriority. Whereas the child wonders \"who am I?\" the adult questions \"what the\nfuck am I doing?\"\n\nThe narrator in Flora Cash's single 18 Dollars is wondering something similar\nbut through the air of perfect hindsight. \"What the fuck were we doing?\"\nAlthough some of us look on heartbreak with a nostalgic kindness, so often we\nchastise ourselves and are subsequently embarrassed by our naivety. Flora Cash\nexcellently capture the moment of recollection through the opening line \"I can\nstill remember just the way you tasted \/\/ pack of cigarettes in a basement.\"\nTaking the narrative back to a period of instant recollection, swooning\narpeggio-ed guitars drop the listener delicately into the misery that is our\nformative memories. For all the youth in the world can't mitigate the utter\nmisery that early heartbreak can render when all you are is all you identify\nwith.\n\nAmongst laughing at ones own history \"I can still get high just thinking about\nus wasted \/\/ 18 dollars for a case kid \/\/ It's all we had\u2026 it's all we knew\" a\nlistener becomes part of a world in which youthful heartbreak is ancient,\nimmature and evidently still incredibly poignant. Because the last time you\ntruly identified solely with your identity is when someone can really hurt it\nthe most. Lines sung in a suggestive scoff are offset by highly polished\ncrescendos of harmonies that slice through themselves with heavy piano drops,\nencapsulating defining formative moments.\n\nShout out to the entirety of the Hype Machine's contributors for getting to\nthis one before me.\n\n","date_published":"2018-05-01T16:41:31.000Z","dek":null,"direction":"ltr","domain":"beerfortheear.com","excerpt":"Two days in a row!

From the time Mei\nbegan on this journey in the world of music, she has gained experience on\nstages throughout her native country and hope to push that boundary even\nfurther in the near future.

EA Sports promises that gamers will access the \"authentic\ntournament experience,\" and a trailer for the new mode arrived yesterday\nfeaturing Cristiano Ronaldo.\n\nThe soundtrack is what really got our attention--we've covered Thutmose and\nNoMBe on P&P, but this is definitely the biggest look of either artist's\ncareer. \"Run Wild\" will appear on an as-yet-untitled EP arriving later this\nyear, and they're already coming with a lot of energy.

Having\nrecently got a new job in Central London, I have been spending the last few\nmonths adapting to the fact I am now a consummate adult and the tangled web of\nresponsibilities that comes with. Not that I'll let that deter me, we all have\nto grow up and progress at some point. I am determined to be the art-world\nequivalent of James Bond that I always dreamed of being.\n\nHaving said that, on some days that is easier than others. Today is certainly\none of those. You could be forgiven, upon looking out your front door on this\nmiserable Monday, that it was more likely to be mid January as opposed to the\nlast day of April. As my girlfriend (who is currently in Florida no less) has\nnoted previously, \"I must be somewhere in London, I must be loving my life in\nthe rain.\" On days like today, I struggle with the London impulse of grabbing\nthe day by it's tired old lapels and instead find myself wanting to float\nthrough the Oxford Street crowds, carried via the throng with my toes barely\ngrazing the ground. A comforting apathy that borders on enjoyable melancholy.\nThe same feeling you get contemplating a lost friend with a cup of coffee in a\nwindow seat.\n\nFortunately, FAVELA's latest single \"Call My Name\" can at least lend a\nsoundtrack to this somewhat self-indulged fantasy. The Leeds-based producer\nand vocalist has created a lo-fi electronic track of exquisite longing that\nsoundtracks your own melancholic montage that occurs between your ears.\nBeginning with slow simple guitar lines that set the tone for a wonderfully\nmeditative soliloquy of lives lived in unwanted isolation. With lines such as,\n\"I confess, I confess I am a writer \/\/ With schewed ambition \/\/ But holy\nvisions,\" this track expertly provides a message to my mood when it rains on\nMondays. It is a track that expertly defines what it means to be in London and\nreally, you'd rather still be in bed, with a lover or just endlessly circling\nthe tube ignoring the outside world. Keep an eye out for the debut LP and whet\nyour appetite with this frankly beautiful song.\n\nCover photo by Michelle Steel\n\n","date_published":"2018-04-30T16:39:11.000Z","dek":null,"direction":"ltr","domain":"beerfortheear.com","excerpt":"For once, I have a legitimate reason for my absence of posting.

While first single  \"How Simple\" continued very inline with what\nfans of Hop Along have come to expect of Frances Quinlan and crew in terms of\nstraightforward composition with just the right amount of lyrical vagueness,\n\"Not Abel\" shook up the band's standard formula by presenting a song with\ndistinct moving parts. \"Prior Things\" arrives to more or less split the\ndifference between the two - continuing to use the strings that were first\npresented in the denouement of \"How Simple\" and instead introducing them right\nat the start before Quinlan even offers the track's first line. The strings\nare bright and spritely, conjuring the sunny, summer day where the song seems\nset to take place. Quinlan sings of a chance encounter - spotting a vacationer\nreading. Perhaps more so than any other song we've heard so far - Quinlan is\nthe least explanatory. Her thoughts spill out of her, but they're much more\nlike observations than judgments even as she places herself both inside and\noutside of the narrative. \"You were on vacation, vacation means leave, means\nobliterate all prior things\" Quinlan croons and it's the first instance of\nthat meeting sidelining other motivations. Quinlan's narrative is mostly\nconcerned with her thoughts and feelings in this particular moment even as she\ntries and fails to understand the concerns of the other party. \"What must\nhappen in your mind when you create those silences - nevermind I don't want to\nsee, it's got nothing to do with me\" she offers. \"Prior Things\" is a bustling\nsprawl that sees Quinlan at a particular vulnerable moment as she ponders in\nidyllic string augmented tapestries just where she fits into everything.\nQuinlan drops listeners right into the thick of her thought process,\nestablishing context first but quickly moving on from the external to her more\ninternal conflict. Quinlan offers up a wealth of information, gradually but\nsurely but makes no attempts to sort any of it for you. The listener becomes\nmore emotional passenger than confidante, viewing the scenes from the safety\nof Quinlan recollection. Quinlan's never been a songwriter who offers\nconclusive \"I feel\" statements instead allowing her emotive vocals and stream-\nof-conscious style do much of the heavy lifting and music place setting.\nUltimately, \"Prior Things\" succeeds because you don't needs to know the\nspecifics. It's a song not only open to interpretation but a fair bit of\nprojection and that makes it strangely universal.\n\nHop Along's third full length album _Bark Your Head Off, Dog_ available April\n6th on Saddle Creek Records. Pre-order is available now.\n\n","date_published":"2018-06-05T13:02:00.000Z","dek":null,"direction":"ltr","domain":"all-aroundsound.blogspot.com","excerpt":"With their follow up their stellar sophomore record Painted Shut out next week, Philly indie rock quartet Hop Along have released \"Pr...","lang":"en","lead_image_url":"https:\/\/3.bp.blogspot.com\/-ZjSp96H3_l0\/WrvKhzGD0RI\/AAAAAAAACVs\/kQ8SNi3MgUY4Cbto6tFi4SpU_Tq_l3WpACLcBGAs\/w1200-h630-p-k-no-nu\/Hop%2BAlong.jpg","next_page_url":null,"pages_rendered":null,"rendered_pages":1.0,"title":"Listen: Hop Along - \"Prior Things\"","total_pages":1.0,"url":"http:\/\/all-aroundsound.blogspot.com\/2018\/03\/listen-hop-along-prior-things.html","word_count":464},{"author":null,"content":"_Peggy Gou hat unser Herz, unseren Geist und unsere Schuhe auf dem Dancefloor\nerobert._\n\nMeiner Meinung nach sollte dies der Soundtrack des Sommers werden!

That song, released in\n2016 on a 12-inch for the Phonica White label, was her first experiment with\nrecording her own vocals\u200b. It effectively laid the groundwork for her new EP,\n_Once_, \u200bout this month on Ninja Tune.\n\nA stylish package of upbeat house infused with vintage synths and Tropicalia,\n_Once_ marks the beginning of a breakout year for the Berlin-based producer,\nas well as her return to the mic.\n\n\"This is all I want to do now,\" Gou tells NPR of her foray into singing and\nsongwriting. \"\u200b[This EP]\u200b was the most fun I've ever had making music. I feel\nlike I found my thing.\"\n\nGou strikes gold with \"It Makes You Forget (Itgehane),\u200b\" the project's lead\nsingle. Swirling together cymbals, conga drums and splashes of acid over a\nskipping house beat, it captures a daytime groove that instantly transports\nyou poolside. Her voice is velvety and laid-back. She toggles between singing\nand talking in airy, nonchalant gusts, making it less of a centerpiece and\nmore of a tool. Like the rest of the instrumentation, its purpose is to\nprovide color, texture and rhythmic flair to help the listener escape. She\npulls it off with an impressive amount of control and restraint.\n\nDespite being a relative newcomer (she left fashion school to pursue music\njust two years ago), Gou seems acutely aware of her limits as a singer and her\nstrengths as a producer and manages to marry them perfectly.\n\nA word-for-word English translation for \"It Makes You Forget (Itgehane)\" would\nbe too confusing since Gou says the phrases are \"too poetic or political,\" but\nthe overarching message is of classic club escapism: loosen up, let go, live a\nlittle. \"The idea is that everyone has something they want to forget, so let's\ntry to achieve that in this song, in this moment,\" she says.\n\nThe bouncy house beat and flickers of vibraphone do a fine job of\ncommunicating that all on their own, but the vocals are what lift it into an\nall-together-now moment on the dance floor. \"What's amazing is that even\nthough people know the lyrics are Korean, they still try to sing it,\" she\nsays, almost laughing. \"I've gotten so many calls asking me to release the\nlyrics so they can sing along.

A video of a live\nperformance of \"Lone Wolf\" is embedded in this post.\n\nSpeaking about \"Lone Wolf,\" Georgi Kay explained that the song is about true\nloneliness:\n\n\"Accepting the fact that no matter how many good people you have in your life,\nthey will never truly know and understand you as deeply and as intimately as\nyou know yourself. What's so funny and oddly comforting about this truth, is\nthat we have all felt this way.\"\n\n\"For me, the song creates a desolate landscape, isolated and untouched -\nmyself being the only living soul within it. That feeling of loneliness and\nsilence forces me to look within myself and reflect on everything that makes\nme who and what I am to a point where I can accept all of it - transforming my\nloneliness into something beautiful.\"\n\nThe instrumentation of \"Lone Wolf\" is layered, but each layer promotes the\nfeel of being alone. We particularly appreciate the low frequency rumbles that\npopulate most to the track. In a live setting, the rumbles likely vibrate the\ncontents of chest cavities of the people close to the stage.\n\nGeorgi Kay is currently based in Los Angeles. She has toured with Tash\nSultana, another looper on the rise.\n\n\"Lone Wolf\" by Georgi Kay\n\n  \n\nFacebook: https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/georgikaymusic\n\nWebsite: http:\/\/georgikay.com\/\n\n  \n\n_Lyrics of \"Lone Wolf\" by Georgi Kay_\n\nIt's like no matter\n\nHow many good people in my life\n\nI feel lonely\n\nAlways feel lonely\n\nIt's just a moment\n\nI get stuck into every time\n\nIt's taking over\n\nMaybe it's your love that I need\n\nHow can I let you in\n\nIf I'm putting up a wall everytime?\n\nYou gotta break it down\n\nIf you wanna come cross that line\n\nHow can you breathe me in\n\nIf you're gonna get no air?\n\nHey I know that\n\nI know that\n\nI know that\n\nI know that ain't fair\n\nWill you think of me\n\nWhen you drive with the windows down?\n\nWill you understand\n\nWhy I'm here with a broken crown?\n\nMy city of dirt\n\nMy home, my heart, my town\n\nNo, I'm not going to leave now\n\nHey yeah\n\nI will always be a lone wolf\n\nThere is nothing you can do\n\nI will always be a lone wolf\n\nForever howling at the moon\n\n[Repeat from start]\n\n  \n\nAn opportunity to appreciate the looping skills of Georgi Kay.\n\n  \n  \nAn opportunity to see Georgi Kay with Lauren Ruth Ward.  \n\n","date_published":"2018-06-05T16:20:00.000Z","dek":null,"direction":"ltr","domain":"indieobsessive.blogspot.com","excerpt":"It\u2019s fitting that someone who has worked to achieve prominent sophistication in live looping should release a song titled \u201cLone Wolf...","lang":"en","lead_image_url":"https:\/\/4.bp.blogspot.com\/-699LIj9ZRQo\/Wt38bTbVAzI\/AAAAAAAAUGM\/FHpaVMw30O8X7lanKAsftNWwrSx66bGGACLcBGAs\/w1200-h630-p-k-no-nu\/Georgi%2BKay.jpg","next_page_url":null,"pages_rendered":null,"rendered_pages":1.0,"title":"\u201cLone Wolf\u201d by Georgi Kay \u2013 A Song Review","total_pages":1.0,"url":"http:\/\/indieobsessive.blogspot.com\/2018\/04\/lone-wolf-by-georgi-kay-song-review.html","word_count":496},{"author":"Publi\u00e9 par\nEl Tino","content":"Chaque fois Billie Eilish frappe un grand coup.

Despite its uplifting title, the lyrics allude to the duo\nattempting to overcome a serious depression. \"Thought I found a way. But you\nnever go away,\" they lament on the opening lines.

Last year saw the release of two new tracks in the form of FoF\ncompilation album cut \"Mirror Mantra\" and Our First 100 Days contribution \"U\nRuined It\" and both were lower energy affairs that eschewed the floor-filling\ntendencies of their previous tracks and remixes in favor of a more mood music\nlike vibe. Considering their methods of gestation and composition - \"Mirror\nMantra\" a reflection of the duo's morning rituals put into music form and the\npolitical protest of \"U Ruined It\", it's hardy surprising that they weren't\noutright bangers but as the only original music released by the duo since\ntheir EP, it did bring to mind that perhaps downtempo would be the name of the\ngame for their forthcoming release. \"What Happened?\" arrives to articulately\nanswer any questions for fans of the group that haven't been able to make it\nout to their live sets. Inspired by the same Upstate NY writing\/recording\nretreat that bore \"Mirror Mantra\", \"What Happened?\" draws its influence from\nthe wide expanses of nature instead of the bustling cities the twosome often\nfind themselves in. It's not a totally alien concept - the inspiration for the\ndigital coming from a return to more organic environments (just look at\nPhotay's Onism) but Gilligan Moss put their personal stamp on it. Where \"It\nFelt Right\" introduced fans to their own produced vocals - \"What Happened?\"\nsees the dynamic duo back to their seamless editing of samples, maneuvering\ntheir multitude of densely textured layers into swift but surprisingly orderly\nformations - not unlike a flock of birds or a colony of butterflies. That\nsense of quickness; of urgency is intentional though. \"What Happened?\" is\ninspired by those moments in life that twist and contort you and that sense\nconfusion and growth that await you on the other side. The \"what happened?\"\nthat closes the song is meant in the purely literal sense as the climactic\nbuild subsides and gives you the chance to reorient yourself. Gilligan Moss\ncontinue to operate at peak form - blending their experimental flourishes with\nuniversally enjoyable elements of dance to create rich, textural tapestries\nthat are also so damn easy to dance to. It's a delicate balance: creating\nmusic that is interesting to listen to while also being accessible but\nGilligan Moss have proved themselves time and time again both as skilled\nwalkers of this particular tightrope but also as fearless producers capable of\npursuing the path less traveled for a track with more depth. The result is\ndance music that appeals to music lovers in general - not just lovers of dance\nmusic and tracks that are beguiling distinct and effortlessly unpredictable.\n\nGilligan Moss' new single \"What Happened?\" is out now on AMF Records.\nHopefully with more to follow soon.\n\n","date_published":"2018-06-05T15:47:00.000Z","dek":null,"direction":"ltr","domain":"all-aroundsound.blogspot.com","excerpt":"Since the release of their debut EP Ceremonial back in 2015, electronic duo Gilligan Moss have avoided a total post-release hiatus wit...","lang":"en","lead_image_url":"https:\/\/1.bp.blogspot.com\/--igONjygnaI\/WtjyNradujI\/AAAAAAAACW0\/az8AZOII9rAVK7mCj9rOAiE5vpqsN6cMACLcBGAs\/w1200-h630-p-k-no-nu\/Gilligan%2BMoss.jpg","next_page_url":null,"pages_rendered":null,"rendered_pages":1.0,"title":"Listen: Gilligan Moss - \"What Happened?\"","total_pages":1.0,"url":"http:\/\/all-aroundsound.blogspot.com\/2018\/04\/listen-gilligan-moss-what-happened.html","word_count":527},{"author":null,"content":"When something becomes the norm we tend to accept it (duh).

Individual songs have flexibility and\nvariety, since the band includes skilled male and female vocalists, as well as\nnon-standard instruments (violin, banjo, cello\u2026). And the eleven songs on the\nalbum will have variety, since all four members of the band contribute to the\nsongwriting. Lyrics are intelligent and often insightful.\n\n\"Born In The Right Country\" is a timely track about the competitive advantage\nin achieving the American Dream. Being born on the \"right side of town\" is not\nsomething a person achieves from a focus on hard work; nor is having \"the\nright skin.\" At times, the message is poignant and pointed - \" _Manufactured\ntruth is easy to sell when you own the factory, and you own the hearts of the\nclientele_. \"\n\nThe first release from the album was \"Van Dyke Brown.\" It is similarly\ninsightful in its exploration of \"finding oneself, finding love, and coming to\nterms with death -- discovering there is cause for celebration in all parts of\nlife.\" The melody is uplifting and percussively rich, particularly when\ncontrasted to \"Born In The Right Country.\"\n\n\" _Kindness, A Rebel_ \" will drop on June 8, 2018 via Roll Call Records. The\nalbum can be pre-ordered by visiting http:\/\/smarturl.it\/KindnessARebel.\n\nRiver Whyless is based in Asheville, North Carolina. The members are Ryan\nO'Keefe (guitars, vocals), Halli Anderson (violin, vocals), Alex McWalters\n(drums, percussion) and Daniel Shearin (bass, vocals, harmonium, cello,\nbanjo). Their tour schedule is included at the bottom of this post. It\nincludes a visit to The Chapel, arguably the most beautiful of the San\nFrancisco venues (for tickets to the SF visit, CLICK HERE).\n\n\"Born In The Right Country\" was penned by the band's Ryan O'Keefe and he\nnotes, \"At its core, 'Born In The Right Country' is about innate luck. Cosmic\nluck, that of an individual, born into a country or society which accepts them\nas that unique individual. Born in the Right Country speaks both through the\neyes of our president and the narrator. In the song, vanity seems to trickle\ndown much more freely than money and you can see it take root in the middle\nand lower classes as we strive to live like the upper. The dominant class is\nbuilt on the idea that anyone can, and should become like them. We were raised\nto call this the American Dream. It's imperative to the success of the upper\nclass that the American Dream stays as it is, a dream. Meanwhile, the reality\npersists, which is that the vast majority of people stay in the class to which\nthey were born. Sure, there are people that break through, in our country\nespecially, but the rich generally stay rich and the poor generally stay\npoor.\"\n\n  \n\n\"Born In The Right Country\" by River Whyless\n\n\"Van Dyke Brown\" by River Whyless\n\n  \n  \n\n**_River Whyless On Tour_**\n\n4\/13\/18 - Nelsonville, OH - Bob Boilen presents @ Stuart's Opera House\n\n4\/14\/18 - Hendersonville, NC - Oskar Blues' Loaded Up & Truckin\n\n6\/1\/18 - Charlotte, NC - Live on the Green at First Ward Park\n\n6\/3\/18 - Nelsonville, OH - Nelsonville Music Festival\n\n6\/7\/18 - Roanoke, VA - Martin's Downtown\n\n6\/9\/18 - Canton, NC - Cold Mountain Festival\n\n6\/12\/18 - Philadelphia, PA - Johnny Brenda's\n\n6\/13\/18 - New York, NY - Bowery Ballroom\n\n6\/15\/18 - Fall River, MA - Narrows Center for the Arts\n\n6\/16\/18 - Allston, MA - Great Scott\n\n6\/17\/18 - Croton-on-Hudson, NY - Pete Seeger's Clearwater Revival\n\n6\/19\/18 - Buffalo, NY - 9th Ward at Babeville\n\n6\/21\/18 - Chicago, IL - Lincoln Hall\n\n6\/22\/18 - Minneapolis, MN - 7th Street Entry\n\n6\/23\/18 - Viroqua, WI - Pierce Hill Performing Arts\n\n6\/25\/18 - Lawrence, KS - The Bottleneck\n\n6\/27\/18 - Vail, CO - Vail Bluegrass Series\n\n6\/28\/18 - Pueblo, CO - Brues Alehouse Brewing Company\n\n8\/2\/18 - Los Angeles, CA - The Moroccan Lounge\n\n8\/3\/18 - Anaheim, CA - The Parish @ House of Blues\n\n8\/4\/18 - San Francisco, CA - The Chapel\n\n8\/11\/18 - Portland, OR - Aladdin Theater\n\n8\/12\/18 - Seattle, WA - Tractor Tavern\n\n8\/18\/18 - Lyons, CO - Rocky Mountain Folks Fest\n\n**More tour dates to be announced.**  \n**  \n**\n\n","date_published":"2018-06-05T10:33:00.000Z","dek":null,"direction":"ltr","domain":"indieobsessive.blogspot.com","excerpt":"A second track from the upcoming album \u201c Kindness, A Rebel \u201d is available for streaming and it adds to the reasons to view River W...","lang":"en","lead_image_url":"https:\/\/2.bp.blogspot.com\/-vDpmYuWZf_c\/WsO3dN8ui7I\/AAAAAAAATuM\/ASopULjxgq4K5yfEYTUp0atuKbFUQm1jQCLcBGAs\/w1200-h630-p-k-no-nu\/River%2BWhyless.jpg","next_page_url":null,"pages_rendered":null,"rendered_pages":1.0,"title":"\"Born In The Right Country\" by River Whyless \u2013 A Song Review","total_pages":1.0,"url":"http:\/\/indieobsessive.blogspot.com\/2018\/04\/born-in-right-country-by-river-whyless.html","word_count":721},{"author":null,"content":"Americana four piece **River Whyless** will release their new album _Kindness,\nA Rebel_ in June.\n\nExcellent new single _Born In The Right Country_ is a political folk song,\nlike a descendent of some of the great  '60s and early '70s protest songs.\n\nFrontman Ryan O'Keefe describes it thus, \" _Born In The Right Country speaks\nboth through the eyes of our president and the narrator.

Bernardt\nonze mailbox binnenrolde, vochten enkele beren meteen uit wie de eer kreeg om\nhet nummer te beluisteren. Het zegt veel dat je op een klein jaar zo'n\nreputatie kan opbouwen. Met slechts een handvol Belgische concerten op zijn\nconto, en nog net iets minder nummers die vrij te beluisteren zijn, heeft\nJinte Deprez bewezen dat J. Bernardt even levensvatbaar als de moederkelk\nBalthazar.\n\nDe diepe subbassen en heldere toetsen die eerder al te horen in \"Calm Down\" te\nhoren waren, zijn opnieuw van de partij. De meeslepende blazers hebben maar\neen half refrein nodig om je in een wereld te trekken waarin ubersexy het\nnieuwe sexy is. Ook blij te horen dat Jinte ook opnieuw zijn gitaar\nbovenhaalt, en nogmaals bewijst dat je geen klavier nodig hebt om verrekt\nfunky te klinken.\n\nHij schreef het nummer naar verluidt nadat zijn lief (aka de tamelijk\nravissante Love Like Birds) uit de douche stapte en een deuntje neuriede.\nKijk, daar zouden wij ook spontaan een hit van beginnen schrijven.\n\nZo'n helft van je leven in Balthazar slijten heeft een duidelijk effect op je.\nZo krijg je de nood om uit te barsten, om iets volledig anders te doen. J.\nBernardt is overduidelijk iets wat Jinte alleen heeft gemaakt. Maar goed ook:\nals compromisloos op de heupen mikken zijn ding is, zullen wij de laatste zijn\nom hem tegen te houden.\n\nJ. Bernardt trekt binnenkort voor een clubtournee door Belgie, waarvan enkel\nde concerten in Brugge en Leuven niet zijn uitverkocht. Deze zomer kan je hem\nook spotten op festivals als Rock Werchter en Dranouter. Het debuutalbum komt\ner ook binnenkort aan.

There are two very big\ncultural poles that always come by Los Angeles and New York. The garage pop\nduo **Me Not You** released _Chemical Cure_ as the last single of their\nupcoming EP, **Reckoning 2** (out this Friday), with very nice lyrics and\nfemale vocals. The song _Chemical Cure_ is their last single of the EP.\nAccording to them, they saved the best for last.\n\nAbout _Chemical Cure_ they say:\n\n> \"we wrote 'chemical cure' on a particular bad day for our country and our\nworld recently. it seems that there are quite a few of these lately. the song\nis about waking up every day and having to face what's going on out there in\nthere world. it's about wanting to, and also not wanting to, lean on chemicals\nto deal with the ups and downs of life. chemicals from the outside and those\npesky neurotransmitters our brain makes. the rise of the morning, the hope,\nand then the apathy that can set in by nighttime\u2026 but also sometimes finding\ninspiration and promise in the gaps of what's left, what's in between.\"\n\nThe duo has been releasing since 2017 and have toured around US and Canada\nopening for Gary Numan to promote Reckoning 1 (2017). About their new EP they\nsay:\n\n> \"When we got back into the studio to write after we put out Reckoning 1, we\naimed to dig deeper than we previously had, sonically and lyrically. We spent\na month experimenting with new synths, found sound recordings, and tons of\nguitar pedals. Lyrically, we tapped into relationships and emotions that we\nhad never really explored in our music. Playing the songs live on our fall\ntour allowed us a more intimate relationship and comfort with the songs, and\nwe definitely brought that energy back with us to the studio. It was also\nimportant for us to keep the songs completely between the two of us\u2026 even as\nfar as mixing the EP ourselves.

Over the course of its extended run\ntime, Lattimore's careful and considered harp plucking is like blissful little\npricks on your skin, slowly and subtly lifting you out of your seat. As she\nunspools a web of perfectly resonant notes, she starts to imbue the\ncomposition with synthesizers; at first a deep and atmospheric bed, like the\ngentle breeze starting to gather under your now floating body, and later on\nmore whizzing effects, like little gusts gently pushing you higher and higher.\nOverall 'It Feels Like Floating' is a testament to what gigantic feats can be\nachieved with such minimal instrumentation, and it promises that _Hundreds Of\nDays_ will be a wholly captivating and engrossing experience.\n\nLattimore, speaking on the inspiration for the track, says: \"It started off\nbeing a song about a description of a guy's drug experience - it was the\nanswer when I asked what it felt like to him. The song morphed into an ode to\nanything that you do alone and personal; be it swimming or skateboarding in\nthe night by yourself; riding a bike or playing a harp in a redwood barn by\nthe Pacific Ocean. It's looking at the world through a filter of blissed-out\ndetachment, untouchable for a minute.\"\n\nListen to 'It Feels Like Floating' below.\n\nPre-order _Hundreds Of Days_ from here ahead of its May 18th release on\nGhostly International.\n\n","date_published":null,"dek":null,"direction":"ltr","domain":"www.thefourohfive.com","excerpt":"The harpist's new album is due in May","lang":"en","lead_image_url":"https:\/\/d3c1jucybpy4ua.cloudfront.net\/data\/58448\/feature\/rsz_mary_lattimore-press_1-photo_credit-rachael_pony_cassells.jpg?1523529883","next_page_url":null,"pages_rendered":null,"rendered_pages":1.0,"title":"Track Of The Day: Mary Lattimore achieves aural levitation on 'It Feels Like Floating'","total_pages":1.0,"url":"https:\/\/www.thefourohfive.com\/music\/article\/track-of-the-day-mary-lattimore-achieves-aural-levitation-on-it-feels-like-floating-152","word_count":296},{"author":null,"content":"\n\n","date_published":null,"dek":null,"direction":null,"domain":null,"excerpt":null,"lang":null,"lead_image_url":null,"next_page_url":null,"pages_rendered":null,"rendered_pages":null,"title":null,"total_pages":null,"url":"http:\/\/www.clashmusic.com\/news\/mary-lattimores-it-feels-like-floating-is-an-out-of-body-experience","word_count":0},{"author":null,"content":"We were impressed with \"Hello From The Edge Of The Earth,\" the lead single\nfrom harpist Mary Lattimore's upcoming album _Hundreds Of Days_ -- so\nimpressed that today we're happy to present the album's next single, \"It Feels\nLike Floating.\"\n\nIt really does, too. The song finds its drifting, airborne effect over the\ncourse of 11 minutes. Lattimore wrote this album during her stay at a seaside\nNorthern California artist colony called Headlands Center for the Arts last\nsummer, setting up shop in a barn with her 47\u00ad-string harp by day and\ncommingling with her fellow artists by night. With that knowledge in hand, the\nsong's ambient sprawl is definitely giving me mental pictures of fog rising\nover the redwoods.\n\nHere's some more context for you: Lattimore plays placid music with a deeply\ntraditional instrument, but she's also going on tour with Iceage this year.\nSee how that expands your understanding of her music by pressing play on \"It\nFeels Like Floating\" below, where you can also find her tour dates.\n\nTOUR DATES: 04\/08 Los Angeles, CA @ Union Station - North Patio 05\/24\nNashville, TN @ Fond Objects 05\/17 Los Angeles, CA @ Zebulon 05\/18 Las Vegas,\nNV @ Bunkhouse Saloon 05\/22 Lawrence, KS @ Brightwood 05\/25 Asheville, NC @\nThe Mothlight 05\/26 Durham, NC @ The Arts Center 05\/27 Philadelphia, PA @\nPhilaMOCA 05\/29 Brooklyn, NY @ Union Pool 05\/31 Nelsonville, OH @ Nelsonville\nMusic Festival 06\/02 Fayetteville, AR @ Stage Eighteen 06\/05 San Diego, CA @\nCasbah* 06\/06 Los Angeles, CA @ The Regent Theater* 06\/07 Felton, CA @ Don\nQuixote's International Music Hall* 06\/08 San Francisco, CA @ The Great\nAmerican Music Hall* 06\/09 Sonoma, CA @ Huichica Music Festival* 06\/10 Chico,\nCA @ Tender Loving 06\/11 Portland, OR @ Mississippi Studios* 06\/12 Vancouver,\nBC @ Cobalt* 06\/14 Spokane, WA @ The Bartlett* 06\/15 Bozeman, MT @ The Rialto*\n06\/16 Salt Lake City, UT @ Kilby Court* 06\/17 Denver, CO @ Bluebird Theater*\n06\/18 Omaha, NE @ Waiting Room* 06\/19 Minneapolis, MN @ 7th St Entry* 06\/20\nMilwaukee, WI @ Cactus Club* 06\/22 Detroit, MI @ El Club* 06\/23 Toronto, ON @\nLee's Palace* 06\/24 Ottawa, ON @ The 27 Club* 06\/25 Montreal, QC @ Sala Rossa*\n06\/26 Portsmouth, NH @ 3S Artspace* 06\/27 Boston, MA @ The Sinclair* 06\/28\nBrooklyn, NY @ Market Hotel* 07\/07 Cape Charles, VA @ Experimental Film\nVirginia 07\/15 Tucson, AZ @ Club Congress ^ 07\/18 Austin, TX @ Barracuda ^\n07\/19 Houston, TX @ Rockerfeller's ^ 07\/20 Dallas, TX @ Nasher Sculpture\nCenter^ 07\/22 Albuquerque, NM @ Sister ^ 07\/23 Phoenix, AZ @ LBX ^ 08\/02\nKansas City, MO @ Riot Room # 08\/04 Denver, CO @ Lost Lake # 08\/05 Salt Lake\nCity, UT @ Metro Music Hall # 08\/07 Los Angeles, CA @ Resident # 08\/09 San\nFrancisco, CA @ Hemlock Tavern # 08\/11 Portland, OR @ Doug Fir # 08\/12\nSeattle, WA @ Barboza #\n\n10\/12-14 Perris, CA @ Desert Daze w\/ Tame Impala, Chelsea Wolfe, and more\n\n* w\/ Iceage ^ w\/ Julianna Barwick\n\n# w\/ Dylan Carlson\n\n_Hundreds Of Days_ is out 5\/18 on Ghostly.

For his next move, however, he\nseems to be moving to a more engrossing, all-encompassing and patient sound\nwith an album called _Nothing Is Still_.\n\nThe new LP, his first for Ninja Tune, is based around his grandparents'\nemigration from the UK to New York in the early 1960s. The full details and\nanecdotes from this time only came to light upon the passing of his\ngrandfather 4 years ago:\n\n\"I knew they had lived in the U.S. and heard many anecdotes, but it was only\nafter Pops died and my Nan presented these polaroids of their time there; of\nher waitressing at the New York Mayor's Ball in '66, or Pops with horses on a\nranch in Arizona, that she delved deeper into their story, and I started to\nbecome overtly inquisitive about it.\" He continued to have in-depth chats with\nhis grandmother: \"I felt the need to document this period for her, and it all\njust sort of snowballed from there.\"\n\nNot only has an album come out of this process, but a novella and a short\nfilm. As such, _Nothing Is Still_ seems set to be much more of a complete\npiece than either of its predecessors. He even enlisted the addition a ten-\npiece string section arranged by Amy Langley, Finn Peters (saxophone and\nflute), and Sam Beste (piano).\n\nAll of this is borne out by the lead single from the album, 'Envelopes\n(Chapter VI)', which is a moody and rain-soaked piece that only leaves you\nbegging for more, as you can feel that it has just a small part of a much\nlarger whole. Not that there's not plenty to engross yourself in through\n'Envelopes'' patient and teasingly beautiful 5 minutes; atmospheric washes of\nsynth, delightfully patient percussion and a breathtaking swoop of violins to\ncap it all off. Check it out below.\n\n_Nothing Is Still_ comes out through Ninja Tune on June 15th, with a new live\nshow to follow. You can pre-order it at vynehall.com.

His career began in the\ndrug addled streets of 1988's New York City and as such provides run ins\njunkies as well as with music industry stars like Big Daddy Kane, Run DMC,\nMadonna, Trent Reznor and David Bowie.\n\nThe book also details his early touring, breaking from Instinct Records and\nsigning with Mute for his first major release \"Everything is Wrong\" and his\ncontroversial Punk\/Ambient album \"Animal Rights.\" For as calm and collected as\nMoby appears in countless press packages he has been as reckless as he is\nresponsible throughout his life. This book exemplifies the eclecticism and\nintelligence that makes Moby as relevant now as when I first became a fan of\nhis in High School with his albums 18 and Play. His new album \"These Systems\nare Failing\" is pretty great as well.\n\n","date_published":null,"dek":null,"direction":"ltr","domain":"web.archive.org","excerpt":"I made some time to actually read a book recently instead of working on ...","lang":"en","lead_image_url":"https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20161229064300im_\/http:\/\/pensandpedals.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/12\/moby.jpg","next_page_url":null,"pages_rendered":null,"rendered_pages":1.0,"title":"Moby \u2013 Porcelain (Memoir)","total_pages":1.0,"url":"https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20161229064300\/http:\/\/pensandpedals.com\/moby-porcelain-memoir\/","word_count":201},{"author":null,"content":"Moby's \"Porcelain\" was released all the way back in the year 2000.

Even if I'm on a plane, 35,000 feet\nabove the earth below, I need to jog my memory with a playback of the song I'm\nwriting about. As much as songs become earworms (and we've written about\nplenty of earworms in our time), it's more difficult to recall exact chord\nstructures, remember the intricacies of lyrics and bring to mind the nuances\nof a track without having heard it. Now, though, as I sail along the Adriatic\ncoast, a few hundred meters out from the rocky peninsulas and beaches that\nmake up the rugged edge of Croatia, it seems infinitely easier to remember\nmusic. With nothing but the hum of the ferry's engine, the muffled gibberish\nof dozens of Swedish, German, Dutch tourists and the occasional screeching\ngull for company, songs present themselves again. Something about the\nunhurried plowing through the water, the velvety reflection of the sun on the\nsea and the gentle progression of the day makes remembering easier. And of all\nthe songs in the catalogued index of my mind, the rusty jukebox of my\nsubconscious, Moby's 'Porcelain' seems most fitting today.\n\nMoby got a bit of a tough break at the beginning of this millenium. After\nEminem proudly proclaimed 'It's over, nobody listens to techno', deriding the\nelectronic artist on 2002's 'Without Me', it almost seemed as though this\nwhite rapper, not yet the superstar he is today, had some prescient ability to\nforesee the trajectory of the far bigger DJ's career. While it remains unclear\nwhether Marshall Mathers was the catalyst for the change, there was a very\ndefinite point of inflection in Moby's professional life where he went from\nbeing the celebrated genius behind masterworks about the human condition ('Why\nDoes My Heart Feel So Bad'), to being cultural excess, a hangover from a time\nwhen the music he made was relevant and an unfortunate, anachronistic reminder\nof how fall he'd fallen from grace. As far as I can tell, there is no precise\nreason for the about-face (surely Em couldn't have had the impact ascribed to\nhim above) but after his 'Extreme Ways' capped off the last of the Bourne film\nspin-offs (as it superbly concluded each of the Matt Damon movies), Moby's\ncultural capital disappeared and he became something approximating 'The Artist\nFormerly Known as Moby' - not in a transformative, Prince-like fashion, but in\na disappearing way like Lily Allen.\n\nStill, Moby comes to me today as I track the Croatian coastline northwards,\nsimply because he was such a force in electronic music in the 90s. Where the\ndecade was otherwise marked by beginnings - of grunge and mainstream hip-hop\namong them - Moby's sound, perfected on his stellar 6th album '18' reflected a\nreally mature approach to electronic music, measured and refined. 'Porcelain'\ntoo, like its creator, might have lost some of its sheen over the years\nbecause of its association with kitschy scenes in film and television but at\nits core, remains a brilliant expression of the Moby movement. Swelling,\ncareening strings and the nonsensical but soulful vocals, combine with\ntinkling, ever-so-slight keys to create a soundscape which is at once both\nlush and intelligent, expansive and simple. The term 'widescreen' is often\nabused in critical writing but 'Porcelain' strikes me as an appropriate track\nto apply the 'widescreen music' label to. It would suit perfectly any large\ncinematic moment and now, played back almost note for note in my mind, works\nnicely with the craggy hillsides and yawning bays of southern Croatia. He may\nhave lost his pop cultural value, or had it stripped of him by an unscrupulous\ndig in a rap song, but Moby's ouevre will likely never lose its memorability.\n\n**Moby - Porcelain**  \n\n","date_published":null,"dek":null,"direction":"ltr","domain":"www.1songday.com","excerpt":"Blogging is always preceded by a song.

So while they have a distinct aesthetic -- native Midwesterner\nDriscoll's boy-next-door vocals paired with native Parisian Syerat's breathy\ncoo -- Freedom Fry's classic pop somehow isn't cookie-cutter. Oh, wait, did we\nsay \"Classic?\" This week the duo announced that \"Classic\" will be the title of\ntheir first full-length album, arriving June 1. The title track holds up its\nend of the deal, with horns and strings right out of '60s AM radio. The string\narrangements came via Phillip Peterson, who's worked with Portugal. The Man,\nand that's Stewart Cole of Edward Sharpe on the trumpet. The buoyant feeling,\nthough, is all Freedom Fry. \"The lyrics paint a semi-serious picture of all\nthe cliche things we can't help but love about L.A.,\" the duo says. \"It's also\nabout feeling like maybe you were born in the wrong time, which we sometimes\ndo.\"\n\n **||| Stream:** \"Classic\"\n\n **||| Previously:** \"Party Down\"\n\n###  _Related_\n\nLearn more\n\nOur editorial newsletter is your ticket to upcoming shows and free stuff.\n\n","date_published":"2018-02-24T19:21:11.000Z","dek":null,"direction":"ltr","domain":"buzzbands.la","excerpt":"After releasing a steady stream of singles over five-plus years, L.A. duo Freedom Fry have announced they will issue their first full-length. \"Classic\" is out June 1.","lang":"en","lead_image_url":"http:\/\/buzzbands.la\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/02\/freedomfry-michelleshiers-1.jpg","next_page_url":null,"pages_rendered":null,"rendered_pages":1.0,"title":"Stream: Freedom Fry, 'Classic' \u2013 buzzbands.la","total_pages":1.0,"url":"http:\/\/buzzbands.la\/2018\/02\/24\/stream-freedom-fry-classic\/","word_count":298},{"author":"Faeton music blog","content":"Hi there.\n\nYou hear the chorus once and this track in your head for a day _(at least)_.\nDo you know that kind of songs? :) This one is exactly that case, so beware \u2026\nAs told one my good friend, when we're played the new track on a rehearsal: _\"\nGuys, this is hit!\"_.

In 2015 they released a couple of EPs, _Heterocetera_ and\n_Agitations_ , which comprised brooding and complex sounds, firmly placing\nthem as one to watch - which was furthered by their being commissioned to\nproduce two remixes for Bjork. This is all prelude to _Power_ , Lotic's debut\nalbum which will be coming out on Tri Angle on July 13th.\n\nLotic says that _Power_ \"originally started as an empowerment album... I felt\nthat I needed to offer something outside of myself, as sort of a healing\nmoment. And then I lost my apartment. Mentally, I could only work on music\nonce every three months or something. The question of what would be empowering\n-- the answer to that changed so often over a two-year period. I had to figure\nout who I was all over again. With this record, I went back and incorporated\nall of my musical selves.\"\n\nAll of that can be heard in the album's mission statement lead single\n'Hunted'. Where previous Lotic releases have been almost entirely crunchy\nelectronic textures, 'Hunted' is relatively pop, as it features whispered\nvocals at its core and something approaching a verse-chorus structure.\nThroughout 'Hunted' Lotic softly intones the powerful proclamation:\n\n_\" brown skin, masculine frame head's a target actin' real feminine\n\nmake 'em vomit\"\n\n_\n\nDespite it remaining in a whisper throughout, these words and their crisp\ndelivery make 'Hunted' as intense as anything else Lotic has released. This is\nthanks to their potent production, making the whispers as sharp as their\nmessage. Around this central motif Lotic constructs crunching and churning\nbeats, gnashing as viciously and fearlessly as the words they're bolstering.\nThis makes 'Hunted' a hypnotic and invigorating track, proving that Lotic has\nmore weapons in their arsenal than we thought - and they know how to use them\nto deadly effect.

All bright tones, smooth rhymes, and dancefloor\nbounce, \"Come Inside\" is the kind of song you reach for when the party kicks\ninto high gear.

Then there's the\nsubtle deviations that pierce through the fog; the occasional flash of colour\nin the surrounding black-and-white; the unexpected shift in tone for the final\nquarter, when Daugherty's voice finally makes a leap for safety: \"Don't let me\ndown,\" she sings in the sudden disquiet, before the thick, impenetrable clouds\nreform once more.\n\nA striking start-point from what promises to be once of 2018's most alluring\nfirst-efforts, you can stream the new track below right now; pre-orders for\nthe ten-track album are available now, via _Western Vinyl_.\n\n~\n\n**facebook.com\/juliana.daugherty.music**\n\n*\n\n","date_published":"2018-04-09T11:15:07.000Z","dek":null,"direction":"ltr","domain":"www.goldflakepaint.co.uk","excerpt":"The appearance of a vey special new voice.

But Daugherty's upcoming album, _Light_ , is not\nsome staunchly academic exercise. It's a collection of stark, intimate folk-\nrock tunes that accompany Daugherty's lyrics with only a few carefully\nselected flourishes.\n\nThe results are magnificent, as you can hear on \"Player,\" the album's opening\ntrack and lead single. Undergirded by a steady metronomic pulse that sounds\nlike someone pounding on an acoustic guitar, fervent but understated electric\nchords carry along Daugherty's haunting narration as droning melodic accents\nsubtly bleed into the mix. I am loath to quote an artist's official bio in a\nblog post, but the comparison to _You Are Free_ -era Cat Power and _Kill The\nMoonlight_ -era Spoon is on point -- and why not go full RIYL and throw Sharon\nVan Etten, Julie Byrne, and Cross Record in the mix? There is no shortage of\nartists making music of this ilk today, but few are doing it so captivatingly.\n\nAs for the subject matter, Daugherty explains:\n\n> I was thinking about the experience of watching someone close to you\ndisappear down a rabbit hole -falling deeper and deeper into some state of\nchaos that's out of their control and yours. The song isn't so much about a\nparticular person as it is about the particular combination of feelings that I\nassociate with this experience: the hurt of abandonment and the feeling of\npersonal failure-failure to understand, failure to help-that contradicts that\nhurt, and compounds it.\n\nListen below.\n\nTRACKLIST: 01 \"Player 02 \"Baby Teeth 03 \"Revelation 04 \"Sweetheart 05 \"Bliss\n06 \"Easier 07 \"Light 08 \"Come For Me 09 \"California\n\n10 \"Wave\n\n_Light_ is out 6\/1 on Western Vinyl.

'Young & Free' is a great track to open the mixtape with;\ninstantly showcasing the evocation and atmosphere that lies within the\nacoustic bones of Kennedy's songs and his hugely impressive vocal. On top of\nthe indie folk foundation is an electronic hip hop presence that adds an\nexciting and eerie edge to Kennedy's style, feeling fresh and contemporary as\nwell as channeling an earthy feel.  \n\n'Couldn't Tell' continues the EPs evocative, and sometimes eerie, nostalgic\ntheme. Kennedy's soulful vocal is melodic and washes over its listener likes\nthe sea hitting the shore. There's a thick yet mellow feel to the production\nthat juxtaposes the sheer passion and intensity to Kennedy's fiery vocal at\nits boldest, which moulds itself into something more vulnerable around the\nmidway mark. Therefore, making this one of the most multifaceted songs on the\nmixtape in terms of both production and showing off Kennedy's vocal range.\n\n  \n  \n'An Evening I Will Not Forget\/ Furthest Thing' marks the middle of the mixtape\njust beautifully with its slow burning piano ballad qualities. There's a lot\nof room for Kennedy's emotive and intelligent storytelling to fully impact and\nthis spills over into the powerful, 'Swim Good'.  \n  \n  \n  \n'Mike Dean Presents: Dermot Kennedy' finishes with 'Moments Passed - (Mike\nDean Remix)' a layered, vibrant and experimental cut that again pairs\nKennedy's raw angst with a warmth and calmness that leaves its listener\nfeeling huge rushes of multiple emotions. Overall, a remarkable and stunningly\ncrafted mixtape that really stays with you after each listen. Dermot Kennedy\nand his authenticity are in a league of their own.  \n  \nWords of **Karla Harris**  \n**  \n**\n\n","date_published":null,"dek":null,"direction":"ltr","domain":"www.whenthehornblows.com","excerpt":"When The Horn Blows | Live Music | Reviews| Interviews | Features","lang":"en","lead_image_url":"https:\/\/1.bp.blogspot.com\/-RjlxZLRASR4\/Wsu3gmWyRwI\/AAAAAAAAIPw\/7YMXGzHypOcVCghLNtsFSmvoT1LQJg-5QCLcBGAs\/w1200-h630-p-k-no-nu\/dermot%2Bkennedy.jpg","next_page_url":null,"pages_rendered":null,"rendered_pages":1.0,"title":"Mixtape: Dermot Kennedy - Mike Dean Presents: Dermot Kennedy","total_pages":1.0,"url":"http:\/\/www.whenthehornblows.com\/2018\/04\/mixtape-dermot-kennedy-mike-dean-presents.html","word_count":313},{"author":null,"content":"Upcoming singer-songwriter **Dermot Kennedy** 's song \"Moments Passed\" gets a\nvibe-heavy remix by premiere hip hop producer **Mike Dean**.

We're told that _Knock Knock_ \"exists outside of trend\nand influence,\" and that \"absolutely every single thing here, from grooves to\nvoices to handclaps, is otherworldly and unique.\" It features disco, soul,\ntechno, hip-hop, and psychedelia--there are even wafts of easy listening, lost\ncrackly thrift store record memories, and indie rock--but \"it never does what\nyour brain thinks it's going to do,\" the label explains.\n\nThe album also features some well-known voices from world music.

In 2017, Alice Merton explosively hit the charts with her single\n\"No Roots.\" Most artists would love to have one hit with the traction and\nsuccess of the song. Since then, we've been anxiously awaiting Merton's next\nsingle with the high hopes that \"No Roots\" would not be her only hit. \"Lash\nOut\" is that single, and it delivers; proving she is not a one hit wonder.\n\nThe phrase \"nevertheless she persisted\" became famous when Senate Majority\nLeader Mitch McConnell said of Elizabeth Warren, \" _She was warned. She was\ngiven an explanation. Nevertheless, she persisted_. \" Much like Warren, the\nlyrics of Merton's song demonstrate the themes of strength and persistence.\nMerton sings, it's \"hard to hold onto this fire inside me.\" As a result, \"I\nwanna let it out. I gotta lash out.\"\n\nThe song's lyrics echo the sentiments of independence and power that Merton\ndescribes through her explanation of the \"Lash Out's\" meaning;\n\n\"Being an artist and a human in this world always means confronting people who\nmake you feel like you have to act according to their rules. Like most people,\nI wanted and still want to live by my own rules. The idea, or, if you like,\nthe need, to write and record 'Lash Out' was born of a feeling within me. \"\n\nAfter a short instrumental intro, Merton's powerful voice enters. The energy\nlevel of \"Lash Out\" remains high throughout. The song has a genuine edge to\nit, which allows you to share Merton's feelings of needing to just lash out.\nThe single was written by Alice Merton with GRAMMY-nominated songwriter Dave\nBassett (Vance Joy, Elle King). Production was done by \"No Roots\" producer\nNico Rebscher, together with Dave Bassett. GRAMMY winner Serban Ghenea (Lorde,\nBruno Mars, Pink) performed mixing.\n\nQuoting the bio (from the kind people at Tell All Your Friends PR):\n\nAlice Merton was born in Frankfurt am Main in 1993 as the daughter of a\nBritish father and a German mother. Her father's job first took the family to\nCanada, then across the border to North America and finally back to Europe.\nAlice studied composition and songwriting at the Pop akademie in Mannheim. By\nchance she met her manager at a bus stop there, with whom she founded her own\nlabel Paper Plane Records International.

The sum of the electronic\nparts are so much greater than their individual pieces, and conjure up the\nsense of grandeur that one can't really plan for with music.  \"Pizza Guy\" is\none of those tracks that turn faces and souls to the sky, listeners dreaming\nof greatness and ubiquitous hope.\n\n  \n\n\"Pizza Guy\" followed the also highly successful \"Real Talk\" with Anne Lunoe.\nFor more from the talented Touch Sensitive, check out his SoundCloud here.\n\n","date_published":null,"dek":null,"direction":"ltr","domain":"www.indieshuffle.com","excerpt":"Listen to and download Touch Sensitive - Pizza Guy.

Oh yes, and Sofi\nTukker rule.  \n  \nNew single _Baby I 'm A Queen_ is the sound of Sofi Tukker grabbing pop by the\nnether regions and twisting them hard until an intense climax. It's all about\na chunky granite guitar riff, Sophie's finest vocal delivery yet and some\ntechno-club beats that thwack like they're trying to raise hell.  \n  \nOf the track the band say: \" _Baby I 'm a Queen_ is about embracing\ntumultuousness and vulnerability.

To start off, Alban usually\nmakes a beat and finds a melody to it while _Yvan_ writes lyrics before\nbringing everything together blending jazz, neo-soul, hip-hop and electronic\nmusic. After two years of radio silence, and two new EP 's on the way there\nwas a lot to discuss.\n\n**Highclouds: Growing up, did you always want to become musicians together?**\n\nNot really, it just happened naturally. We started playing around with\ninstruments (guitar, ukulele, xylophone) when we were around 13 and _Yvan_\nstarted singing for fun. We were mainly doing covers at the start but we\ndecided to write our own songs just to see how it would be.\n\n**I guess it turned out pretty well ! You just got signed to _Majestic Casual\nRecords_ , how did that come about?**\n\nWe just reached out to them on Facebook telling them we love their YouTube\nchannel and would love to collaborate with them for our next release. They\nreplied they all loved the EP unanimously and that they were totally down to\ncollaborate with us. They sent us a contract and that's how it happened! We\nare so happy to collaborate with them since we've been following them from the\nstart, it means a lot.\n\n**Your new single \"Blame\" is our favourite song on the upcoming EP, a real\nspringtime gem. What was it like making that song?**\n\nThanks a lot! We've had a demo of this track for more than a year now and we\nfelt like there was something missing. We asked _Lennard Vink (VYNK)_ to come\nover to Brussels to chill and record some keys on it. We knew that is was\ngoing to be great, so we let him record a couple ideas. The saxophone player\nyou can hear on it is a friend of ours called _Brice Clausse_ who also\ncontributed to our debut album with _Le Motel_ called  \"Mellow\".\n\n**It sounds like you collaborated with some talented people on this project,\ncan you tell us more about them?**\n\nActually, all the tracks are co-produced by our friend _VYNK_. He is a genius\nkeyboard player and multi-instrumentalist from Rotterdam. He plays with a band\nthat we are fans of called _Day Fly_. It 's easy to work with him as he\nunderstands our vibe, he is also one of the nicest person we've met: we are\nvery proud to work with him. We collaborated with an Australian singer called\n_St.South_ on the previous single. She discovered our music on SoundCloud a\ncouple of years ago and really liked it. We sent her some instrumentals and\nshe recorded some vocals which we 're very happy with.\n\n**How do you feel before finally releasing the EP in a month?**\n\nWe are excited to release a new project and to be back in the game! We now\nwork with _Back In The Dayz_ for bookings and there is another EP coming in\nJuly! We took the time to listen to a lot of music and gather inspiration from\nvarious artists such as _Daniel Caesar, Jordan Rakei, River Tiber, Tom Misch,\nMoonchild, Robert Glasper, Mr. Jukes, D 'Angelo, JMSN, Smino, Cosmo Pyke,\nHenry Wu, FKJ, Mahalia, Monte Booker, Quickly Quickly, Persian Empire_ and\nmuch more\u2026\n\n### \"We already had a lot of stuff that could've been released even 2 years\nago but we weren't happy with it. It would've been \"too easy\" to release those\nsongs\u2026\"\n\n**We can indeed hear that you 've matured sonically. Did you need a break or\nmore time to be \"happy\" with your work?**\n\nWe really wanted to have a better musical quality and to create our own\n\"sound\" with all those influences. It took us a lot of time to build these\nsongs up, especially in terms of lyrics. We really wanted to have a coherence\nbetween all the tracks lyrics wise. We did need a break to create new songs.\nWe already had a lot of stuff that could've been released even 2 years ago but\nwe weren't happy with it. It would've been \"too easy\" to release those songs\nbecause it was almost the same vibe as what we already released. We wanted to\nget out of our comfort zone and create something new.\n\n**Finally, what 's the story behind your band name?**\n\nWhen I ( _Alban Murenzi_ ) was around 15 I bought my first guitar (a black\nfolk guitar) this yellow strap at the store and thought \"this could be a great\ncolour match with my guitar\". My brother and a friend of ours who used to play\nwith us ( _Ludovic Petermann_ ) both bought the same strap as mine. That's how\nthe name came out.\n\n**Get your tickets for their EP release party at \" _Les Nuits Bota_\" where\nthey're headlining with _ULYSSE_ and _Otzeki_ on May 3rd or catch them in July\nat _Les Ardentes_**.\n\n","date_published":"2018-03-24T19:00:14.000Z","dek":null,"direction":"ltr","domain":"www.highclouds.org","excerpt":"YellowStraps will release \u201cBLAME\u201d their 4-track EP on April 20 via Majestic Casual.

While we're eager to hear all the new\nmusic set to head our way, one of the projects we're most looking forward to\nis **Tom Misch** 's _Geography_. The singer\/producer 's debut is one that\nlooks promising, especially if his last single \"Movie\" is any indication.\nWell, ahead of the set's April release, he offers up a calming and reassuring\nslice of soul with the set's next release \"Water Baby.\"\n\nThe track is kicked off with a dreamy haze of music as Tom sings the track's\nchorus. \"'Cuz I was born a water baby\/Swimming with these times\/The grooves\nthat turn the gray to sunshine,\" he sings, offering a bit of optimism for the\nperpetual turmoil we've come to find ourselves in these days. That is then\nfollowed by an opening rap from frequent collaborator **Loyle Carner** , who\ndrops a quick 16 detailing worries and solutions to problems. It goes along\nwith the narrative that Tom paints throughout the track, on which he\nencourages listeners to learn to go with the ebb and flow of life while\nappreciating the here and now. Sure, it's not the most profound of messages,\nbut it's one that most definitely needs to be heard from time to time. And if\nit's heard over jazzy piano, horns and hip-hop-influenced drums, well that's\neven better.\n\nTom Misch continues to show out in the lead-up to _Geography _ and we\ndefinitely aren't mad at any of it.

Undeterred, the pair\nreevaluated and entered the music business via a different avenue,\ncollaborating with the likes of Maggie Rogers and Charles Fauna. Once they'd\ngained better clarity on how the industry operated, they released their first\nsingle as Glassio, 2016's dreamy \"Try Much Harder\".\n\nA number of singles later and Glassio have fully refined their indie pop blend\nof house and R&B sounds, as demonstrated on their new song, \"Back for More\".\nAt times as much a nod to _Graceland_ as it is to AIR,  \"Back for More\"\nmanages to remain uplifting even as it reveals itself as a pining, forlorn\nlove song. Beat machines kick up the time as piano notes lay down heavily\nunder lyrics that lament, \"But if it takes some time\/ To rid me of my whiskey\nand wine\/ I hope that I don't find my sight\/ While I'm blinded by you.\"\n\nTake a listen:\n\nTo help shed light on how they got to their uniquely calming electronic sound,\nGlassio have broken down the Origins of \"Back for More\". See what they have to\nsay about Christine and the Queens, Sticky, and Talking Heads below.\n\n**The Santoor:**\n\nSam brought this instrument back from the Middle East and we immediately began\nworking on placing it in or sets, and using it to play arpeggios under beats.\n\"Back for More\" started with a beat and the santoor you hear in the bridge\nbefore the melodies began coming together. It was the base for the whole song.\nHaving it in there put this image in our heads of wooden clock towers crying\nand we really liked that. This song is all about dependency and time slipping\naway. We needed that effect of time fleeing in there.\n\n**Talking Heads -- \"This Must Be The Place\":**\n\nThis song has been in our lives since we were early teenagers so it was a\ncompletely subconscious move to have our intro synth sound pay homage to the\nintro synth in this song. That flute\/synth part in the intro has always made\nme think of flowers yawning. That expression was really important for our\ntrack. We wanted this song to be a mix of yin and yang. The beginning - in our\nheads - was a sunrise, and once the vocals kicked in, you're out of bed and\ngoing 100mph.\n\n**Sticky -- \"Triplets II & III\":**\n\nWe've been really into to lots of drum and bass, 2-step and UK garage the past\ncouple of years -- particularly the past year. This British producer was\nmaking great stuff in the early 2000s garage world in the UK. Love how\naggressive the beats are but yet how playful the instrumentation on top is.\nAlso love how dry and to the bone the textures are. Makes me think of a\nkindergarten music teacher after school trying to rebuild drum and bass sounds\nusing only the musical equipment on campus. We were very keen on the idea of\nmaking something that felt like a d&b lullaby to an extent.\n\n**Christine and the Queens -- \"Tilted\":**\n\nWe probably referenced her almost half of the time when working on the song.\nWe imagined how she would choreograph the track, how she would sound on it. We\nlove the colors in \"Tilted\" and think she's absolutely incredible. She has\nsynth sounds in her music that sound like birds whistling sweet nothings and\nthat was definitely something we wanted to emanate. Her music videos also work\nwith color and light so well, we had those playing all the time while working\non the track.\n\n**Our \"Back for More\" visualizer:**\n\nTowards the last 25% of working on the song, we put this video together as\nsomething to play on a projector in our studio as a means for us to get our\nheads out of the music and let our eyes make decisions for our ears. That's\nbeen a huge thing for us. Visuals often drive everything in the music we make\nand we constantly are staring at a projector while working. It's almost as if\nwe think of the music video beforehand, and make the music for the video.\n\n","date_published":"2018-03-20T18:16:17.000Z","dek":null,"direction":"ltr","domain":"consequenceofsound.net","excerpt":"New York indie pop duo look to Talking Heads and Christine and the Queens on their new single.","lang":"en","lead_image_url":"https:\/\/consequenceofsound.files.wordpress.com\/2018\/03\/glassio-origins.jpg?quality=80","next_page_url":null,"pages_rendered":null,"rendered_pages":1.0,"title":"Glassio share the Origins of their yearning new single, \u201cBack for More\u201d: Stream","total_pages":1.0,"url":"https:\/\/consequenceofsound.net\/2018\/03\/glassio-share-the-origins-of-their-yearning-new-single-back-for-more-stream\/","word_count":756},{"author":null,"content":"Some of the best moments in music come from the unexpected.

The London-bred\nproducer\/musician\/beatmaker\/singer is barely into his twenties, yet many\nconsider him a fixture in the current UK music scene. A sonic stroll through\nhis current body of work, along with an impressive list of collaborative\ndetours ( **Jordan Rakei** , **Marie Dahlstrom** , **Alfa Mist** , **Emmavie**\n, **Carmody** and **Loyle Carner** to name a few), exhibits an unfaltering\ncommitment to his craft. And now that he 's announced his long-awaited debut\nalbum _Geography_ , due next spring, we're expecting to hear his best work\nyet.\n\nFanning the flames of our anticipation is his newest release \"Movie,\" the lead\nsingle from the forthcoming project. The track begins with a bit of dramatic\nflair, thanks to a monologue by Tom's sister Polly as a bluesy guitar strums\nin the background. Over downtempo percussion and lingering synth chords, Tom's\naching vocals give us all the feels as he replays scenes of his old\nrelationship and pines for his lover to return. \"It kills me to see you leave\n\/ So I came home and made this beat \/ Baby, come back to me \/ Come back to\nme,\" he pleads. A jazzy piano solo transforms the soulful slow jam into a\nsultry groove as he coos, \"Remember me, let's set the scene\/ You and me, what\ncould've been \/ Still swimming in a lovers' dream \/ Still playing on the movie\nscreen.\"\n\nWhether you're looking add some heat to your Netflix & Chill playlist, or\nhoping for something to last beyond cuffing season, this \"Movie\" is definitely\nworth the price of admission.

The album is mainly composed of saxophone recordings that have been\nsampled and processed through electronic software and hardware. Larger\nimprovised sections and partial composed melodies blend together through\nrhythmic repetition, harmonic textures, and ambience. The ambience plays an\nimportant role and comes naturally from recording in various big rooms at the\nCultural Center and former beer brewery Tou Scene in Stavanger.

Partners,\nchildren, parents, siblings, best friends, and pets don't count. Now think\nback to when you were 17 (if you're this age or younger think about the\npresent), who were your admirers? They probably didn't include Richard Hawley\nand Simone Felice of The Felice Brothers. But for Aberdeen, Scotland native\n**Katie Buchan** , these are just two of a growing list of artists who have\necstatically exalted her talents as **Best Girl Athlete**.\n\nIn 2015, Buchan released her debut album, _Carve Every Word_ , which turned\nheads across the UK, including Hawley and Felice. The young artist is now\nabout to add to her growing list of devotees, as today she is unveiling a new\nsingle, **\" In Your Head\"**, which we have the great honor to premiere.\n\n\"In Your Head\" is a stunning piece of cinematic drama that is akin to the\ngreat plays that occupy Broadway in New York City and London's West End. The\nsong's intro immediately reins the listener in with fluttering strings and a\nLatin-influenced guitar. The plot then revs up, as the music turns into a\nboisterous, soulful, pop number to accompany Buchan's intensifying vocal. When\nthe horns kick in and the bass becomes amplified, the song explodes and pure\ndelirium unfolds. Although Buchan chants, _\" I don't want to be in your\nhead\"_, her voice and this seismic affair will be stuck in your mind for hours\nif not days. When it's all said and done, you, too, will join the likes of\nHawley and Felice as fans of Scotland's next great musical export.\n\n\"In Your Head\" is available as a free download. Just click the SoundCloud\naudio below or click here. Then choose \"More\" and \"Download\".\n\nBuchan's new album, _**Best Girl Athlete**_ **,** arrives October 2nd, 2017\nvia Fitlike Records. Look for new music, including the LP's first single, to\nbe released in the weeks ahead.\n\nFollow Best Girl Athlete at: Website | Facebook | Instagram | Twitter\n\nShare This Article On...\n\nFollow The Revue On...\n\n","date_published":"2017-08-01T10:45:49.000Z","dek":null,"direction":"ltr","domain":"therevue.ca","excerpt":"Aberdeen singer-songwriter Katie Buchan \u2013 a.k.a.

The new\nsingle follows in the footsteps of Green's other chilling tunes such as \" _Do\nYou Know_ \", \" _Slow_ \" and _'Another Light_ '. With a strong cult following\nfrom his past two Eps, with also eight million Spotify streams, you can say\npeople have been craving more music from the electronic artist. Green's icon\nmellow vocals and haunting electro instrumental tone is present in \"\n_Something_ \", proving he's definitely giving his fans what they have been\nwaiting for.\n\n\" _Something_ \" encourages the listener to take a break from whatever they are\ndoing, wherever they are and journey off whether it be to the sea side,\nforest, highway or local cafe. The cinematic tone makes this a very visual\nsingle, creating a complete atmosphere for the listener. With the subtle blend\nof indie singer, song writer and electronic music, the track feels like a\nmeditative breath.\n\nWhen asked about the single **Henry Green** stated, _\" \"Something\" is about\nhaving someone, or something, that consistently provides you with warmth and\nlight, even when you're seemingly in the darkness. I wrote it for those people\nin my life, the ones who give me that energy.\" _\n\n**The debut album \" _Shift_ \" is set to release on 30th March, only ten short\ndays after the release of \" _Something_ \". Henry Green is set to start his\ntour 21s t April and is set to headline a London show for Corsica Studios on\n3rd May. Many hope this debut album will spark more tour dates worldwide. **\n\nWords By **Stormie Cueto**\n\n","date_published":null,"dek":null,"direction":"ltr","domain":"www.whenthehornblows.com","excerpt":"When The Horn Blows | Live Music | Reviews| Interviews | Features","lang":"en","lead_image_url":"https:\/\/2.bp.blogspot.com\/-f2joUa9OIzw\/WrlgjudqyTI\/AAAAAAAACig\/E-TY7u5QYjQ4FmhfVoDn1bUiOrhOsc8mQCLcBGAs\/w1200-h630-p-k-no-nu\/unnamed-10.jpg","next_page_url":null,"pages_rendered":null,"rendered_pages":1.0,"title":"Single Review: Henry Green - 'Something'","total_pages":1.0,"url":"http:\/\/www.whenthehornblows.com\/2018\/03\/single-review-henry-green-something.html","word_count":308},{"author":"S\u00e9bastien","content":"\ud83d\udcaa Partagez, tweetez pour soutenir le blog. \u00c7a m'encourage a continuer et \u00e7a\nfait toujours plaisir.

So now you don't\neven have to bother reading the blog - you can just follow the playlist and\nonce a month take a dive into everything I've covered. Simple.  \n  \nYou can find the Breaking More Waves monthly playlist by clicking on this link\nhere.  \n  \nFebruary started with the brand new and rather excellent Chvrches single _Get\nOut_ and it ends in a similar way, with another new song called _My Enemy_ ,\nwhich means I can conveniently bookend the playlist with Chvrches songs. And\nlet's face it if you are going to have two songs by one artist on any new\nmusic playlist, it might as well be by Chvrches.  \n  \nSo, what do you all need to know about _My Enemy_? Just these 5 simple things:  \n  \n1. On first listen I thought it was a 7\/10 song. After another six or seven plays I've revised my opinion to an 8 or 8.5. It might even become a 9. If you listen just once and think it's a 9, we've both gone on the same journey. It's just yours was via the equivalent of a high speed jet plane and mine was via a slow cycle in the country. Different journeys, same result, and when the result is a good one that's all that matters.  \n  \n2. It features Matt Berninger of The National. Some hardcore pop fans might possibly be saying 'who?' but then I've never particularly thought of Chvrches as a hardcore pop fans band - they're more of a pop band for people that don't normally like pop music, if that makes any sense? And the sort of person that likes pop music for people who don't normally like pop music will undoubtedly know who Matt Berninger is.   \n  \n3. Despite that bloke from The National being involved, Lauren from Chvrches sings the best bits (the hook). But then it's her band so why shouldn't she? Otherwise he'll just get all the credit and he has his own bloody band to do that with.  \n  \n4. It's a ballad of sorts. But don't worry. It's not cheesy.  \n  \n5. Any pop ballad that has words like so cold, so callous, so vile, so vicious and the emptiness will go on and on probably isn't going to be a total barrel of laughs. But then the new Chvrches album is called _Love Is Dead_ , so it's to be expected really.  \n  \n**Chvrches - My Enemy**  \n**  \n**\n\n","date_published":"2018-06-05T21:45:00.000Z","dek":null,"direction":"ltr","domain":"breakingmorewaves.blogspot.com","excerpt":"At the end of every month (e.g. today) I update my Spotify Breaking More Waves playlist, deleting all the tracks I wrote about on the blo...","lang":"en","lead_image_url":"https:\/\/4.bp.blogspot.com\/-QjyWGmXZZS8\/WpccfhXtReI\/AAAAAAAARGc\/QU2ldIvYSaw0AemKOt9rlx1SF_7X1cEzwCLcBGAs\/w1200-h630-p-k-no-nu\/chvrches%2B1.jpg","next_page_url":null,"pages_rendered":null,"rendered_pages":1.0,"title":"New Music: Chvrches - My Enemy","total_pages":1.0,"url":"http:\/\/breakingmorewaves.blogspot.com\/2018\/02\/chvrches-my-enemy.html","word_count":445},{"author":null,"content":"The Marias' single, \"I Like It\" is a prophecy to how we think you'll feel\nabout it ( **hint** : we think you'll like it).\n\n  \n\nThis track emits a mix of electronic and dream pop.

While well received, the praise and respect was not enough to go\nanywhere near making up for the confidence sapping experiences she went\nthrough at the hands of the industry and label men associated with recording\nand marketing the record. Recovering from the horrific experience of being a\nfemale artist on a major label where your music talent is subordinate to other\nconcerns and you're surrounded by sexist and condescending men can take a long\ntime. The arrogance and disrespect turned Attar off creating music for five\nyears. She recently had this to say to The Line Of Best Fit;\n\n_\" To be honest life just happened. Created life for example. But also I had a\nrough patch, confidence-wise after the last album for some reason. Maybe\nbecause I was working with shitholes, that could be part of it. I was super\nsurprised about how uninterested some people in the business seemed in\nwhatever I actually could do with music. They seemed more interested in\nwhether I looked pretty in photos the way they wanted me to or not, and that\nattitude took me completely off-guard. Maybe I was naive. Hence me putting the\nback of my head on the cover of Sleepyhead for example, haha! Always doing\nopposite of what I'm told. Anyhow, I got over that pretty fast, the lost\nconfidence turned into fuel and here I am.\"_\n\nThat the behaviour shocked her despite that fact she'd being around music for\na decade speaks volumes. Attar may call not seeing it naivety but nobody\nshould apologise for expecting people to treat them with decency and respect.\nSometimes it takes a dose of reality and shock to the system to realise real\nrespect for artists and the notion of unfettered artistic freedom does not\nexist in the mainstream music world. But from such experiences can come great\nchange and renewal. Where that respect does exist however is at the Swedish\nindependent imprint PNKSLM Recordings which incidentally started its life the\nsame year Sleepyhead was released. So it was great to see Attar and the\nStockholm based label join forces for her return, the forthcoming six track EP\nPaloma's Hand.\n\nOn the basis of the two singles released thus far, Attar is determined to\nrepresent life as it is and break down barriers created by stifling\nconventional wisdom. They are very different beasts musically too with first\nsingle 'Run' exuding a definitive darkness musically while latest single, 'I\nDon't Have To', is delivered in classically uplifting pop style. Lyrically\nboth reflect two subjects close to the heart of many women. 'Run' is a track\nabout escaping from alcohol related domestic violence while 'I Don't Have To'\nis a work of cathartic defiance and unflinching honesty in the face of\nsocietal expectation. The latter is arguably the best thing she has ever done.\nPaloma's Hand is out on April 27.

The live version of 'Butterfly' lands softer on the ear than its\nbold and incredibly polished studio version, showing off the song in a\nmellower, less layered form. The verses emit a warmth and breeziness in its\nguitar work and vocal delivery that reminds me of what Natty brought to the\ntable with his song, 'Bedroom Eyes', although lyrically more substantial. As\nthe track develops, it's really nice to see McGrath juggle a smooth,\nsoulfulness alongside a deeper, indie fieriness, showing restraint yet hinting\nthat if she wanted to fully unleash into rockier waters, she very much could.\n'Butterfly' is the second song to be revealed from McGrath's upcoming debut\nEP, 'Silent Minds', which saw her team up with producers including Grammy\nAward winning Jimmy Hogarth, Brit School alumni Jackson and Rhiannon Mair.\nWith 'Love You Better' and 'Butterfly' to go on, Emma McGrath's music career\ncarries the scent of so much promise.\n\nWords of **Karla Harris**\n\n  \n****  \n_The new single 'Butterfly' is available for streaming and digital download\nHERE  .

The\nrelease of the single 'Love You Better' proved that she's been putting these\nadvantages to good use, delivering a knock out pop single that springboarded\nher to a new platform of success. Today she follows it up with 'Butterfly', a\nsong that shows a fiercer and scrappier side of her personality.\n\nIn 'Butterfly' we hear the same determination as in 'Love You Better', but\napplied to a more trying subject matter, that of people not accepting change -\nespecially within their close friends. Over marching drums and stadium-sized\nguitar strums, we can hear McGrath purposefully pulling away from the people\nthat have become a drag on her life, pushing herself on to bigger and better\nthings and showing apathy towards those who won't accept these moves. The\nmuscular message is imbued by natural pop swagger and subtle production\nflourishes, making 'Butterfly' a ready-to-go live anthem.\n\nEmma tells us this about the song:\n\n\"Butterfly' is about being a decent person, getting rid of the fake people in\nyour life and doing what is morally right instead of following the crowd. It's\nbased on an experience I had when a new student joined our school and how I\nended up at odds with my group of friends, over stupid things, about accepting\nthe new person.\n\n\"The song is aimed at two sides. The verses + middle 8 to the group that\ndidn't accept the new person and the chorus aimed at people in life who get\nlet down by others due to lack of understanding of situation and letting them\nknow that you'll stand by them even if it's slightly detrimental to your own\nsituation.\"\n\nListen to 'Butterfly' below.\n\nEmma McGrath's debut EP _Silent Minds_ comes out on April 13th and can be pre-\nordered here.

This\nis heightened through the implementation of Daya's captivating vocals that\ndabble in and out of the high and lower ends of her range, which is\nstrengthened strategically through Grime's utilisation of reverb that adds to\nthe ambience holding the track together.\n\nIn building anticipation for the trademark intensified drop we've all come to\nknow and love, RL Grime subtly signifies a shift in intensity through some\noff-kilter percussion and the injection of bass that builds a solid foundation\nto launch from. Once launched, we see significant amounts of fuzz from the\nsynths, a shift in force from the percussion that penetrates through the mix\nand the emotionally piercing vocals from Daya that when combined results in a\nresounding chorus full of character.\n\nFurther to the single, RL Grime provides a unique, non-conventional lyric\nvideo for 'I Wanna Know'. Directed by Grime, Daya, and **Dan Streit** , the\nlyric video gives viewers an insight behind the scenes of the track with\nvarious imagery of Grime and Daya mucking around, visions of Grime live at\nfestivals, and much more. What stands out in this video is the way in which\nthe delivery of the lyrics matches the intensity of the production in the\nmusic. The moments leading up to the drop see the lyrics displayed in a\n'shaky' nature, highlighting the instability of the emotional context within\nthe track.\n\n**Stream\/Buy:** **Future Classic**  \n**Artist Connect:** **Facebook** **|** **Soundcloud** **|** **Twitter** **|**\n**Spotify** **|** **Instagram**\n\n","date_published":"2018-03-19T00:00:00.000Z","dek":null,"direction":"ltr","domain":"acidstag.com","excerpt":"Following on from headlining FOMO Festival and dropping the massive \u2018Stay For It\u2019 (featuring Miguel), LA producer RL Grime continues to showcase his ever expanding repertoire with the latest release&hellip;","lang":"en","lead_image_url":null,"next_page_url":null,"pages_rendered":null,"rendered_pages":1.0,"title":"RL Grime \u2013 \u2018I Wanna Know\u2019 Feat.

In a\npress release, Hollingworth explains, \"It's about communication. Some of the\nlyrics reference being in control as a woman in a romantic relationship, and\nbeing the one to initiate.\" Sonically, the song mirrors that sentiment by\nunfolding a bold, confident musical vision.\n\nLike its predecessor, \"Falling Into Me\" errs on the side of experimental\nelectronic pop music, but it does so with radically different textures and\nmoods than Let's Eat Grandma employed on \"Hot Pink.\" The track shifts shape\nseveral times over, eventually building toward a saxophone-infused climax that\nsounds like a club remix of an M83 track.

Her name is Sigrid. She's from Norway. She\ndoes pop music. You of course have already heard of her, or you've been living\nunder a rock.  \n  \nSigrid is brilliant. She can do all the things that are required of brilliant\npop music. She has great tunes. She can sing. Boy oh boy can she sing. She has\nthe moves. She has a great band around her.\n\nBut there's more than that. Because any great art has to have more than the\nsum of its parts to really resonate. Songs are great to connect with, but it's\nall the other stuff that surrounds popular culture that's just as important.\nOf course, it's a dangerous thing to do - putting artists on pedestals can\nlead to them falling off - but if we didn't, how would we ever show off their\ngreatness to others?\n\n  \n  \nAnd Sigrid is great. Not just because of the music, but because of the way she\nis. There's no artifice or act. People who argue that authenticity in music is\nimportant (often fans of men with guitars) will even find it difficult to\nargue that Sigrid doesn't have that authenticity in huge bucket loads. Of\ncourse, they'll argue that it's 'just pop', but when you've been to a show\nlike the one I saw Sigrid perform last night, it's possible to see that\nsometimes pop isn't 'just pop'.  \n  \nFrom her simple stage attire (jeans, plain t-shirt and tied back hair) to her\nself-aware and unassuming nature (before thanking the audience for coming to\nthe show last night she asked \"Can I be a bit cheesy now, is that OK?\") to her\ninability to surpress her emotion (last night at the start of _Don 't Kill My\nVibe _Sigrid became so overwhelmed with the reaction she couldn't sing, so she\njust held the microphone out to the audience who sang the words back whilst\nshe stood and cried - it was a beautiful moment that made even the hardest of\nus well up a little). These are the things that, combined with the music, make\nSigrid special. There is something about her pure and raw.  \n  \nWhich is 398 words just to shoehorn the word _Raw_ into the conversation,\nwhich just happens to be the title of the new song from Sigrid.  \n  \nIt's the first in a collection of brand new material, set to drop every week.\nIt's not a banger. Don't worry banger fans. If you wanted another _Don 't Kill\nMy Vibe \/ Plot Twist \/ Strangers _she has more of those to come. But having\nwatched Sigrid's set grow over the six times I've seen her one thing that is\nbecoming apparent is that she's a much more versatile pop artist than one that\njust does in your face jams. This one is stripped back to the very core.  \n  \n\"No apologies for being me,\" sings Sigrid on _Raw_. I think this much about\nher we all know.  \n  \n**Sigrid - Raw**\n\n","date_published":"2018-06-05T21:10:00.000Z","dek":null,"direction":"ltr","domain":"breakingmorewaves.blogspot.com","excerpt":"There\u2019s a school of thought that suggests that pop music somehow has less depth than other forms of music like rock, jazz, or soul.

Today's Neu Pick comes from Thunder Jackson._\n\nWho are Thunder Jackson? Well, here's what we know: Thunder Jackson isn't one\nman but instead a duo, formed after a chance encounter in a Los Angeles taxi\ncab. Moving past the general niceties and a little bit of suspicion, it soon\nbecame clear to both parties that they were both restless, eagerly searching\nout something new.\n\nFor a year, the pair - one originally from Oklahoma and the other from the\nsouth coast of Wales - have been working in a basement on the city's west side\non their debut album. After that, little is known about the pair who make up\nThunder Jackson. Except that, whoever they are, they know how to piece\ntogether a song that's both danceable while also swimming in a pool of\nmelancholy.\n\nTheir debut single 'Guilty Party' features snapping beats and twangs of funk-\ninflected guitar, as well as acrobatic vocals that skip over the lyrics like\npoetry. Into that mix is a tale of messing up, the vocals explaining that \"I\nwas fucked up\/ It's not what I meant\". The hook even plays on a tasty pun,\nsaying \"guilty party\/ Dancing in the mess I've made\". Whatever incident they\nmight be referring to, the mysterious duo certainly haven't made a mess of\nbringing their work into the world.\n\nListen to 'Guilty Party' below.\n\n","date_published":"2017-11-23T00:00:00.000Z","dek":null,"direction":"ltr","domain":"diymag.com","excerpt":"The mysterious duo\u2019s funk-inflected track is today\u2019s Neu Pick.","lang":"en","lead_image_url":"http:\/\/diymag.com\/media\/img\/Artists\/T\/Thunder-Jackson\/_1200x675_crop_center-center_75\/TJTHREE1.jpg","next_page_url":null,"pages_rendered":null,"rendered_pages":1.0,"title":"Thunder Jackson emerge with debut single \u2018Guilty Party\u2019","total_pages":1.0,"url":"http:\/\/diymag.com\/2017\/11\/23\/thunder-jackson-guilty-party-neu-pick-listen","word_count":246},{"author":"Alex Gardner","content":"Nov 22, 2017\n\n\"What exactly is a Thunder Jackson?\" a lady's voice asks near the beginning of\n\"Guilty Party,\" the debut song from a duo of the same name. Although Thunder\nJackson is avoiding too many specifics about the individuals behind the music,\nthey have shared a little bit of information about how they met:\n\n\"One evening two summers ago, a restless young songwriter in his early 20s got\ninto the back of a taxi. Far from his Oklahoman roots, this was to be just\nanother aimless night in the bourgeois bars of the Sunset Strip. By some kind\nof serendipitous fortune another equally restless young man happened to be\nslumped in the passenger seat of this particular ride. This man, even further\nfrom his homeland, the mountains and valleys of Wales, was a record producer.\nFate, coincidence, or just sheer luck? Whatever the case may be, conversation\nquickly steered towards music. The marvelous melody of Marvin Gaye, the poetic\nprose of Paul Simon and the lack thereof in modern music. By the time the ride\nwas over, a line had been drawn in the sand. Thunder Jackson was born.\"\n\n\"Guilty Party\" has a classic feel and a vintage-looking video, and it's just\nthe first song from a whole album of material which Thunder Jackson has been\nworking on in L.A. for over a year. Listen to the premiere of the song now and\nlearn a little more about it below.\n\n**Thunder Jackson on \"Guilty Party\":**\n\n\"Picture this, a bohemian house party, on the outskirts of a desert town and\nthe consumption of hallucinogenics & cheap liquor, at the age where one's mind\nis not equipped to deal with such potent elixirs. Picture also, a young woman\nseen through such warped perspective, weaving her way towards our young hero,\nacross the parties flickering light. Without hesitation and especially\nthought, words of love and adoration are professed. In the light of morning,\nand with a ten ton hangover, such meaningless and whimsical words fly around\nour hero's head. He could apologize but he alas does not, choosing instead to\ndance in the mess he has made. A selfish and needless act, he is the guilty\nparty.\n\n\"For further inquiry, please do not hesitate to leave a message for Thunder\nJackson here: 310-486-7882.

Enlisting the honey-eyed and swift vocals of Los\nAngeles' songstress Sofi De La Torre, \" **Jump** \" cultivates a middle-ground\nof post-core 2000 vibes with a modern production that is earcandy for 2018.\n\nCo-produced by Imad Royal, \" **Jump** \" travels down the imagery of blunt\nlyrics, \"if you jump, I'll jump too\", assuring there isn't a height too high\nfor Black or De La Torre. Acting as Black's first ever duet, the natural\ncourse of vocal plays between the two artists make this statement hard to\nbelieve. Indulging in the story of two lovers outdoing themselves for the\nultimate declaration of love, the spiraling actions radiate of slight\ndesperation. While the nature at first may seem lighthearted due to the\nrhythmic blend, the undertone truly comes from a darker shade.\n\nCourtesy of the artist via Facebook\n\n\"I'm just staying true to how I feel in the moment. Right now my songs come\nfrom a darker place. I didn't think about other people at all honestly. I am\nhonored that people have reacted the way they have and that has been the most\nbeautiful thing. It has given me a purpose.\"\n\nContinuing his raw and honest collection, Black's musical styling and\nvulnerability are a cool glass of water that easily become appreciated from\nstart to finish. Connecting fans and inviting new ones who swim easily between\ngenres, Black is the bridge for various musical worlds and a fogged glass for\nour own reflective emotions.\n\n","date_published":"2018-03-12T13:00:10.000Z","dek":null,"direction":"ltr","domain":"girlundergroundmusic.com","excerpt":"LA creatives team up for an alternative blend of dark love.","lang":"en","lead_image_url":"https:\/\/girlundergroundmusic.files.wordpress.com\/2018\/03\/jumpcover.jpg?w=1200","next_page_url":null,"pages_rendered":null,"rendered_pages":1.0,"title":"Gabriel Black and Sofi De La Torre Test Each Other on \u2018Jump\u2019","total_pages":1.0,"url":"https:\/\/girlundergroundmusic.com\/2018\/03\/12\/gabriel-black-and-sofi-de-la-torre-test-each-other-on-jump\/","word_count":276},{"author":null,"content":"\n\n","date_published":null,"dek":null,"direction":null,"domain":null,"excerpt":null,"lang":null,"lead_image_url":null,"next_page_url":null,"pages_rendered":null,"rendered_pages":null,"title":null,"total_pages":null,"url":"https:\/\/sodwee.com\/blog\/2018\/03\/new-music-gabriel-black-jump-feat-sofi-de-la-torre\/","word_count":0},{"author":null,"content":"**Gabriel Black** est un artiste am ericain que l'on decouvre aujorud'hui avec\nson single **_Jump_**.\n\nPour son premier duo, le chanteur se fait accompagne par **Sofi de la Torre**.\nEnsemble, ils livrent cette Pop alternative sur fond de guitare s eche.\n\nSi vous voulez suivre le parcours prometteur de **Gabriel Black** , voici les\nliens vers ses comptes Soundcloud ou Facebook.\n\n","date_published":"2018-03-12T05:00:24.000Z","dek":null,"direction":"ltr","domain":"pausemusicale.com","excerpt":"Gabriel Black est un artiste am\u00e9ricain que l\u2019on d\u00e9couvre aujorud\u2019hui avec son single Jump.

Haux wrote\nthe solitary chords of 'Ricochet' at his upright Bechstein piano in an\nunfurnished, reverb-heavy apartment in the Berkshires, Massachusetts that he\nnow calls home. These glistening moments remain central to the song which is a\nreal headphones moment. **\n\nHaux himself recalls the romantic story of writing this one as follows: \"While\nrecording the final vocals for 'Ricochet' I was reminded of the empty living\nroom and the Bechstein. I remembered the woman who sold me the piano saying it\nhad been in her family all of her life and that her grandmother had played it\nevery morning growing up until her husband left her. She said that she never\nplayed it again after that. The family had the piano maintained but it was\nnever the same, she said. That story hit me hard and was all that I could\nthink about when I sang, \"If I'm the rock, you're the ricochet\".\n\n**Listen to 'Ricochet' - BELOW:**\n\nHaux is the project of photographer-turned-musician Woodson Black. His songs\nare spacious and haunting, anchored by ghostly vocals and sparse, icy synths.\nWith this visual background, Haux's music is naturally very cinematic and\nBlack is readying a self-directed short film to accompany the release of the\n'Something to Remember' EP next month.\n\nIn celebration of the EP's release, Haux will embark on a 28-date headline\ntour across North America and Europe, including a night at London's Omeara\n(1st June) and a night at Glasgow's Stereo (2nd June).

One spoonful of\nnostalgia with a dash of 1998 ensures a listening experience like no other xo\"  \nNot a girl, nor having any affiliations with Pizza, his music ranges from\nquirky, ironic, 80s informercial-esque pop to darker and more introspective,\nEuropean influenced electronica.\n\nIt's a small operation. With the help of a thrown together flatpack mini\nstudio, Pizzagirl writes, records and produces all of his music and visuals\nfrom the comfort of his home. His best mate shoots his videos and his mum\ntakes his press shots.

It is a downer-disco from UK. **Coffee Shop** is his\nnew track, though it talks about caffeine and not magical herbs sold in\nhomonymous places here in Netherlands. This artist has an announced new EP due\n13th April. It all starts with a very catchy intro, with na-na-na (Hey Jude\nstyle) vocals, with dance-able and catchy instrumental lines.\n\n**Pizzagirl** is Liam Brown. There are several different influences on this\ntrack, from 80s pop to current pop-rock and disco. The vocals are a very\ninteresting part of the track, where high-timbre voices speak about a coffee\nshop while the lead singer follows them with his man 's voice together with\nthe basic instruments.\n\nThis is not at all an exaggerated pop-style, but something done in an\nunderground bedroom in UK that stand out from the pop being done nowadays. The\nproducer does everything himself from the comfort of his bedroom studio, as\nmany of them (Including me, except for the fact that I am using my kitchen as\nstudio). The synths sound just amazing.\n\nCoffee Shop has been released this 9th March by label **Heist or Hit. ** The\ntrack is available for streaming in Spotify.\n\nThe artist has some UK dates to perform, so if you live in the UK, you can\ncheck his laptop lonesome live (and let us know how it was).\n\n**APRIL**\n\n12th - YORK, The Fulford Arms (with Her's) 19th - LIVERPOOL, EBGBS (with\nHer's) 20th - SHEFFIELD, Picture House Social (with Her's)\n\n21st - EDINBURGH, The Mash House (with Her's)\n\n","date_published":"2018-03-18T10:15:07.000Z","dek":null,"direction":"ltr","domain":"synthsofeden.com","excerpt":"Disclaimer: Ok, this blog doesn\u2019t want to be that much focused on pop music, but mainly progressive\/psychedelic rock and crazy electronic material; however, there is a bunch of independent ni\u2026","lang":"en","lead_image_url":"https:\/\/synthsofeden.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/03\/Pizzagirl_Coffee-Shop-Press-Photo_preview-1024x684.jpeg","next_page_url":null,"pages_rendered":null,"rendered_pages":1.0,"title":"New Pop: pizzagirl \u2013 Coffee Shop (2018)","total_pages":1.0,"url":"https:\/\/synthsofeden.com\/2018\/03\/18\/new-pop-pizzagirl-coffee-shop-2018\/","word_count":364},{"author":null,"content":"Weder eine neue Pizzakette, noch das weibliche Geschlecht steckt hinter\nPizzagirl.

It's an enormous posse\ncut featuring Kendrick Lamar, Jay Rock, Future, James Blake, and an addictive\nMike Will Made-It and Teddy Walton-produced beat. The result is as raucous as\nit is potent.\n\nJay Rock, who will also claim the track as the lead single for his upcoming\nand as-yet-unnamed album, brings one of his best performances yet. His flow\nmoves at a furious pace but his tone is laidback, as if his regal wordplay is\ntotally off-the-cuff: \"Menage-a-trois\/My queen gon' roll up...I reign all\nday\/You know, confetti,\" he snaps. Future, for his part, is at his most\nplayful: He transforms his scratchy voice into an helium-infused falsetto to\ndeliver an audacious Three 6 Mafia shout-out (\"La di da di da\/Slob on me\nknob\") in the middle of a track made for a Disney-owned movie.\n\nIt's far from a conventional pop soundtrack addition, and right as it seems\n\"King's Dead\" could reach a climax, the production suddenly runs out and a\nhazy breeze kicks in, swirling around James Blake's ghostly vocals. And like a\ndream becoming a nightmare, the tempo falls, 808s rise, and cars skid and\ncrash in the background as Kendrick takes his throne, channeling the middle-\nfingered aggression of the movie's villain. \"All hail Erik Killmonger,\" he\nproclaims, pausing to take in some air before jumping into an unrelenting\nverse. The reference is a small Easter egg for fans of the comic, one that\nfulfills its duty to the source material without neglecting Lamar's artistic\nimpulses. Most of all, the song is fun and swaggering; its energy makes you\nwant to imagine the sort of scenes it could back. And with _Black Panther_\nalready laying waste to Marvel presale records, there will be no better way to\npull up to theaters than by banging \"King's Dead.\"\n\n","date_published":null,"dek":null,"direction":"ltr","domain":"pitchfork.com","excerpt":"The latest salvo from the Black Panther OST is raucous","lang":"en","lead_image_url":"https:\/\/media.pitchfork.com\/photos\/5a591ca303bd5639c74e332f\/1:1\/w_500\/artworks-000283787126-jhdajj-t500x500.jpg","next_page_url":null,"pages_rendered":null,"rendered_pages":1.0,"title":"Listen to \u201cKing\u2019s Dead\u201d [ft.

The latest in a string of Swedish hitmakers to attempt a\nbreakthrough in the United States shares a first name with the \"Habits\"\nsinger; in fact, and she wants you to wear it out (it's pronounced TOO-vah) on\nher latest single, \"Say My Name.\"\n\nSwedish audiences first became familiar with Tove Styrke in 2009, when the\nsinger was just sixteen and placed third on _Swedish Idol_. After releasing a\nhigh-octane self-titled LP in 2010, she reinvented herself for 2015's _Kiddo_\n, favoring a more alt-pop approach and some definite feminist overtones. The\nalbum went platinum and earned her a Grammy nod in her home country, but with\nher first track since its release, Styrke makes a major bid for international\nsuccess as well.\n\nThe minimal bounce of \"Say My Name\" certainly recalls The Knife's\n\"Heartbeats,\" but blossoms quickly into an earworm in its own right with a\nplucky guitar line and a bombastic, beckoning bridge. When Styrke sings, \"wear\nit out like a sweater that you love cause you can't get enough,\" she might as\nwell be talking about the song itself; every element here seems primed to give\nlisteners a major serotonin boost, much like discovering a new object of\ninfatuation. Falling in love is a universal feeling that Stryke captures best\nwith the line \"You speak my lingo, we don't need no translation;\" with her\ntrack fostering a new obsession, we have to agree wholeheartedly.\n\n#### **Governors Ball Presents: Pond on 5\/30 @ Warsaw**\n\n####\n\n","date_published":"2017-04-28T20:28:08.000Z","dek":null,"direction":"ltr","domain":"www.audiofemme.com","excerpt":"In the vein of Robyn, Icona Pop and Tove Lo comes Swedish electro-pop singer-songwriter Tove Styrke's ode to infatuation, \"Say My Name.\"","lang":"en","lead_image_url":"http:\/\/www.audiofemme.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/04\/TOVESTYRKE_PHOTO_cEmma-Svensson.jpg","next_page_url":null,"pages_rendered":null,"rendered_pages":1.0,"title":"TRACK OF THE WEEK: Tove Styrke \u201cSay My Name\u201d","total_pages":1.0,"url":"http:\/\/www.audiofemme.com\/track-week-tove-styrke-say-name\/","word_count":278},{"author":"Oblivious Pop","content":"Tove Styrke is finally back and ready to continue her rise to the top of the\npop game with new single \"Say My Name\".

Can you share a\nlittle about what you 've been up to since then?**\n\nAbsolutely. I've been hard at work in the studio for the past two years. It\ntook me awhile to find this new direction, but when I finally found it\neverything just clicked for me. I love this sound and that it's quite the\nopposite of what I did last time. It's important for me to always keep\nreinventing myself and challenging myself creatively. I think that's important\nin life in general, like, you don't wanna feel like you know yourself. You\nshould surprise yourself constantly.\n\n**What about \"Say My Name\" made you want to choose it as your first single\nback? What made it stand out to you?**\n\nFor me it was a no-brainer to go with \"Say My Name\" first. It was the first\nsong me and Elof did together and I feel like it really raised the bar in\nevery way. Like \"how are we gonna even top this one?!\" I've simply been mad\nfor it since the beginning. I think it has a vibe to it that just makes it\ncool and approachable and simple at the same time. I love that.\n\n**That bright little riff that opens \"Say My Name\" caught me by surprise, but\nimmediately hooked me. This is a catchy pop song, but it manages to stay\nunique. Can you tell me what it was like working with Elof Loelv and what you\nguys were going for?**\n\nYeah I know right? I had to fight a little bit to even make him hit record for\nthat riff. It's a crappy little red ukulele, Elof plays it. I think him and I\nare very in sync with what it is that we want to do. We wanted \"Say My Name\"\nto feel effortless and at the same time grab your attention. And it's nice to\ngeek out completely with somebody. I try to not leave any stone unturned, I\nwanna make sure that every part of the song really is the best we can come up\nwith.

It's also worth noting that while 'Legends' is\npredominately feel-good, there's a dark antithesis there too. LANNDS provide a\nsnapshot of brooding, especially in the track's bass beats. Around the midway\nmark, the duo explore their own inner storms, while implementing that thematic\nnarrative into the sonic elements too. Therefore the sum of 'Legends'' parts\nsees it become a gorgeous, slow burning, tropical storm in its entirety.\n\nWords of **Karla Harris**\n\n  \n****  \n\n","date_published":null,"dek":null,"direction":"ltr","domain":"www.whenthehornblows.com","excerpt":"When The Horn Blows | Live Music | Reviews| Interviews | Features","lang":"en","lead_image_url":"https:\/\/2.bp.blogspot.com\/-iUPE7-U3-BI\/WsVMsqtODVI\/AAAAAAAAIN4\/Y2DTCb1kUNQYLfupIYYI-x4JAQsSlFlNQCLcBGAs\/w1200-h630-p-k-no-nu\/LAANDS.jpg","next_page_url":null,"pages_rendered":null,"rendered_pages":1.0,"title":"Single Review: LANNDS - 'Legends'","total_pages":1.0,"url":"http:\/\/www.whenthehornblows.com\/2018\/04\/single-review-lannds-legends.html","word_count":187},{"author":"Synths of Eden","content":"> \"We're all legends in this town, we don't sleep through the night, oh we'll\nburn this city down, make room for the fire.\"\n\nFeatured in both our International Women's Day and Chilling in Eden playlists.\n**LANNDS** comes with **Legends** as a pretty and chill song.

Malena has been moving around locations\nfor a while now, most notably in her brother 's house in Aliso Viejo,\nCalifornia where she recorded her album. However, she still holds her origins\nclose to her heart, and they come rising beautifully to the surface in her\nmusic, as we've seen in her debut singles 'Should I Try' and 'If It Goes'\n(about her mother). She is set to expand upon these themes in her debut album\n_Aliso_ , arriving on April 13th.\n\nAs a signifier of the ambitions of _Aliso_ , Malena Zavala has released the\nfive-minute musing single 'A Vision That's Changed'. It's a song that ambles\nand flutters delicately to begin with, as Malena considers time's passing and\nits effect on her memories and the relationships that are tied so closely to\nthem, how they are subtly but unalterably changed each time you see that\nperson or relive that memory again. 'A Vision That's Changed' is slight and\nshimmering, much like a memory that could slip out of sight or out of grasp if\nyou get too close or lose concentration for just a second. Thankfully Malena's\nquivering vocal holds tight to your heart and guides you through this\nbeautiful haze, into a resounding instrumental conclusion that shows an artist\nspreading her wings for flight.\n\nCommenting on the thoughts involved in 'A Vision That's Change', Malena says:\n\"Memories stay the same but people don't, so what if that person came back to\nme. Would they even be the same? I don't think so, so it's about letting go.\"\n\nListen to 'A Vision That's Changed' below.\n\nMalena Zavala's debut album _Aliso_ comes out through Yucatan Records and can\nbe pre-ordered here.

It's\na track that wouldn't be out of place soundtracking a dramatic heartbreak\nscene in a film, but instead of the two characters running back into each\nother's arms at the climax of the song, they both move on.\n\nSpeaking about the song, Zavala explains the background of her realistic take\non hearbreak, saying \"This song is reminiscing about a past love, but it\nfocuses more on their memory that is frozen in time.

She was\ninitially lost, then struck out on her own -- eventually decamping to his\nhouse across one ocean and one country and striking inspiration for her new\nsolo work.\n\nThe end result is a series of songs that are rooted in Zavala's experience,\ntracing themes including \"cultural identity, self-doubt, acceptance \u2026 [and]\nmiscommunication between cultures.\" Appropriately, subtle rhythmic allusions\nto Latin music underpin and twist urbane textures and searching dream-pop\nvocals, all of it coming together under the California sun into a fried, hazy\naesthetic that conjures aimless journeys up and down the Golden Coast looking\nfor a revelation. At times, _Aliso_ sounds like a languid watercolor affair, a\nyearning vocal or specific hook acting as the punctuations, the linchpins in\nZavala 's life.\n\nZavala has been previewing _Aliso_ for a few months now, from early looks at\n\"If It Goes\" and \"Should I Try\" through to the recent, humid night paean\n\"Could You Stay.\" Now, she's returning with \"A Vision That's Changed.\"\nZavala's newest single unfolds patiently, at first sparse and plaintive until\nit gradually builds to a gorgeous outro full of layered vocals and aqueous\nguitars.

She\nopens the track, singing, \"You got me going, got me glowing \/ Hoping you're\ndevoted \/ I get this feeling you've been scheming, stealing \/ Am I dreaming?\"\nShe's feeling him something serious, but she's no pushover. Charles challenges\nhim on the chorus, taunting, \"Don't play fair, don't play nice \/ If you're\ngonna do it, do it right,\" and gets him right together.\n\n\"'Do It Right' came out of a session in Los Angeles with GRAMMY Award-\nnominated writer\/producer Rob Kleiner,\" Nuela shared with us about the song's\nformation. \"We wanted to create an upbeat, snappy tune that had some attitude.\nThe song is a bit cheeky and basically says 'if you're gonna do it, better do\nit right.'

It's a tour.\n\n### Dermot Kennedy Autumn 2017 Tour\n\n21\/9 - Maze, Berlin 24\/9 - Tivoli, Utrecht 25\/9 - La Boule Noire, Paris 28\/9 -\nOmeara, London 1\/10 - The Louisiana, Bristol 2\/10 - The Deaf Institute,\nManchester 3\/10 - Chapel, Leeds 5\/10 - Stereo, Glasgow 7\/10 - Roisin Dubh,\nGalway 8\/10 - Limelight 2, Belfast\n\n9\/10 - Button Factory, Dublin\n\nSee all Nialler9's Best of 2017's lists\n\nPosted on September 20th, 2017 \/\/ Author: Nialler9\n\nArtists:  Dermot Kennedy\n\n###### Read next:  Antal & Hunee are playing Dublin's Tengu; here's how to get\naccess to the first round of tickets\n\n### Related:\n\n","date_published":null,"dek":null,"direction":"ltr","domain":"nialler9.com","excerpt":"","lang":"en","lead_image_url":"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/nialler9.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/09\/21752717_912829275535329_1663766340628859898_o.jpg?fit=1200%2C1200&ssl=1","next_page_url":null,"pages_rendered":null,"rendered_pages":1.0,"title":"Dermot Kennedy \u2013 \u2018Moments Passed\u2019","total_pages":1.0,"url":"https:\/\/nialler9.com\/dermot-kennedy-moments-passed\/","word_count":179},{"author":"janette","content":"Photo: Nicole Nodland\n\nUnearthed, midnight thoughts lead Dermot Kennedy to a sentient take of time on\nthe latest track \" **Moments Passed**. \" The Dublin-based artist's explosive\nyet poised sense of distressed emotions revive a spiritual connection that\nseems to effortlessly emerge from this track, becoming a signature trait for\nKennedy. Revolving around the smallest of details, \"Moments Passed\" is crafted\nto age smoothly while also highlighting Kennedy's growth as an artist.\n\nBuilt from a sampled production with an ample amount of future-bass and R&B\nflare, the modern drop keeps the track relevant. It's somewhat aggressive and\nsturdy, acting as a locked memory on repeat aching for Kennedy to layer, who\ndoesn't disappoint. The spiritual awakening is met with Kennedy's past wishes,\nfuture scenarios, present demons, and brash questioning: \"I loved you, does\nthat mean nothing to you now? \/ I loved you, get me back on holy ground.\"\n\nAside from lyrics that cut deep and a production that lingers, \"Moments\nPassed\" comes to full completion through Kennedy's delivery. Words may stand\nalone, similar to the production, but Kennedy's raspy and emotive vocals\nmanipulate these sounds to create a texture of enlightened reality from penned\nthoughts.

Now they're taking an even bolder step\nforward with their new single 'Confessional', which is as honest and deeply\nemotive as that title might suggest.\n\nThe duo tells us, \"'Confessional' is a song written from the perspective of\nsomeone struggling with mental illness while trying to keep a relationship\ntogether. Having the realisation that they might not ever recover from the\nillness, their only choice is to confess to their partner that they may not\never be capable of change, hoping that the truth will solidify them. In a\nbittersweetness they know their partner will not leave, however, they cannot\nreconcile with their decision to stay.\"\n\nThat world-tearing inner turmoil is certainly tangible in 'Confessional', with\ndeeply thumping bass like a nervous heart, coupled with skittering percussion\nsuggesting a fidgety demeanour, we get the feeling of being in a body full of\nmental and physical discomfort yearning to be unburdened. The couple's\nintertwining vocals, coupled with stylish synth beds, suggest a desired\nintimacy, like two disconnected inner monologues trying to reach out for each\nother but not quite having the courage to make the first move. As\n'Confessional' reaches its climax and all these elements come to a swirling\nwhole, you feel as though the confession is right on the tip of their tongues,\nwaiting to be released into the intimate environment of two lovers, ready to\nbe explored and confronted together.\n\nListen to 'Confessional' below.\n\n'Confessional' will be released tomorrow as a single, and will feature on\ntheir _Sight_ EP, coming this summer.

The track exudes too much badassery\nfor anyone to second guess what her intentions are, and we're totally\nenthralled. Not only that, but her incredible honesty has us thinking she's\ngot quite a bit of staying power.\n\nThankfully, we caught up with her to get a little intro to the woman behind it\nall. Check out the full interview below!\n\n___\n\n**If you could introduce yourself to an audience in any way, no limitations,\nhow would you do it?**\n\nHi, I'm Evalyn. I live in Venice Beach, California and like to write songs\nabout ego and feeling like shit and the things in your head that you don't\nwant people to know you're thinking.\n\n**Did you have an \"aha\" moment when you decided that music was your calling?\nIf so, what was that like?**\n\nMusic has always been as natural to me as breathing. Growing up, when I wasn't\nobsessing over classic rock and hip hop records, I was singing in church which\nturned into singing in bars. Music is the great love of my life and anytime\nI've ever turned my back on it I've lost myself. It's a severely co-dependent\nrelationship (but don't tell music cuz I think I need him more than he needs\nme).\n\n**So what has it taken to get you here in your career, to this moment? Has the\nroad been long and winding?**\n\nI'm dramatic so I'd say holy shit it's taken forever, but the truth is what\ntook me a long time was learning the hard lessons I write about in my songs.\nAnd looking back I wouldn't change a thing. Plus I have some really groovy\npeople in my life who've had my back every step of the way.\n\n**\" Filthy Rich\" is such a vibey and honest track. What inspired it?**\n\nYou know that feeling when someone fucks with you and you just want to hold on\nto an ounce of your pride? To me, Filthy Rich is that internal conversation\nyou have in order to pick yourself up off the ground. It's about that front\nyou put on so you look bulletproof. That shit is very real to me and is so\nreal in Los Angeles.\n\n**\" I thought you knew I was a bitch\" is a line we were NOT expecting, and\nwe're actually kind of in love. In this context, what does \"bitch\" mean to\nyou, specifically? **\n\nGiven the option of being vulnerable and getting hurt or shutting someone out\nfirst I'd choose the latter. It's something I've done since I was young and I\nshould probably fix it, but c'est la vie. To me, bitch means I am not to be\nfucked with, you can't hurt me. Honest and upfront as well because I value\nthat above all else - I'm an over sharer.\n\n**What is your writing\/production process like?**\n\nI like to start at the piano. If a song can be stripped to just a piano and a\nvocal and still send shivers down your spine, that's when you know you've got\nsomething. Lyrics are what I live for so I usually take a cue from Hemingway\nand try and write hard and clear about what hurts.\n\n**What would be on your ultimate rider list?**\n\nHaha that's a great question, I play this game at the bar with my friends. I\nhear Jack White's rider includes bourbon, Veuve Cliquot and really dope\nguacamole - I'll take that, sub tequila for bourbon.\n\n**What 's up next, darling?**\n\nI've got some more Filthy Rich surprises up my sleeve, starting with a remix\nor two. And look out for a follow up single.\n\n___\n\nKeep up with Evalyn here.\n\n","date_published":"2017-03-15T07:00:50.000Z","dek":null,"direction":"ltr","domain":"www.imposemagazine.com","excerpt":"On the heels of collaborative success with Louis The Child\u2019s \u201cFire\u201d and her mashup cover of \u201cThe Hills x Nightcall\u201d, Evalyn\u2018s official solo debut has been instilling itself into the hearts of many.&hellip;","lang":"en","lead_image_url":"http:\/\/4ca03fhcpiv4bsn7vbg2ef11td.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/03\/evalyn_Tommy-Dingwall.png%201200w,%20http:\/\/4ca03fhcpiv4bsn7vbg2ef11td.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/03\/evalyn_Tommy-Dingwall-210x310.png%20210w,%20http:\/\/4ca03fhcpiv4bsn7vbg2ef11td.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/03\/evalyn_Tommy-Dingwall-768x1134.png%20768w,%20http:\/\/4ca03fhcpiv4bsn7vbg2ef11td.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/03\/evalyn_Tommy-Dingwall-693x1024.png%20693w","next_page_url":null,"pages_rendered":null,"rendered_pages":1.0,"title":"Evalyn Shares Recent Track \"Filthy Rich\", Talks What's Up Next and Dream Rider List - Features","total_pages":1.0,"url":"http:\/\/www.imposemagazine.com\/features\/evalyn-shares-recent-track-filthy-rich-talks-whats-up-next-and-dream-rider-list","word_count":648},{"author":null,"content":"### Error.

While he\nended his 2017 by hitting the road with T-Pain for his acoustic tour, the\nvocalist will be lighting up some festival stages this upcoming summer season.\n\nTake a listen to the new track from Tobi Lou and Smino, and catch the\nnostalgic visuals below.\n\n**Check Out the 2018 Hip-Hop Music Festivals You Need to See**\n\n","date_published":null,"dek":null,"direction":"ltr","domain":"www.xxlmag.com","excerpt":"Smino teams up with Tobi Lou for their new song ''Troop,'' and releases a nostalgic music video.","lang":"en","lead_image_url":"http:\/\/www.xxlmag.com\/files\/2018\/03\/smino-tobi-lou-troop-video.jpg?w=600&h=0&zc=1&s=0&a=t&q=89","next_page_url":null,"pages_rendered":null,"rendered_pages":1.0,"title":"Smino Joins Tobi Lou on New Song ''Troop'' - XXL","total_pages":1.0,"url":"http:\/\/www.xxlmag.com\/rap-music\/new-music\/2018\/03\/smino-tobi-lou-new-song-troop\/","word_count":231},{"author":null,"content":"In Tobi Lou's world, anything can happen.\n\nInspired by the limitless possibilities of cartoons, the young Chicago artist\nis fueled by playful creative freedom. \"There's something about a world where\nanything is possible, and it can be as crazy as you want or as real as you\nwant,\" he says. \"I feel like some people lose that magic when they get older.\nWe're dealing with real shit, so I get it. But even when dealing with real\nshit, you've still gotta have a sense that anything can happen as if your life\nis a fuckin' cartoon.\"\n\nHis career is still in its early stages, but Tobi has figured out that his\ncreativity can spread far beyond the music itself. He's built an inviting\nworld full of cartoon characters, whimsical visuals, and a unique personal\nstyle. Of course, none of this would matter if the music wasn't great. After\ngaining early buzz with songs like \"Pretty Please\" and \"Game Ova\" in 2015, he\nkicked this year off with an excellent three-song EP called _tobi lou and the\nMoon _ that showed off his ear for melody and an ability to write clever,\nrelatable songs.\n\nWe've had our eyes on Tobi Lou for awhile now, but today feels like a major\nstep forward with the release of his video for \"TROOP\" featuring Smino. A song\nabout enjoying the reality of being by yourself, this might be his best work\nyet. Director Glassface--who's been collaborating with Tobi on all of his\nvideos--agrees. \"We've made a lot of videos together but I feel like 'TROOP'\nis the most special,\" he says. \"We tried to make the greatest video of all\ntime. 'TROOP' is a mixed media trip through Tobi's imagination.\"\n\nWatch the premiere of \"TROOP\" below and continue for our full interview with\nTobi Lou.\n\n**Can you catch me up on your background before the Tobi Lou stuff started?**\n\nI came to Chicago from Nigeria when I was like two years old. Then I ended up\nplaying in an independent professional baseball league. It was basically\nequivalent to Class A ball in the minor leagues. I was in Joliet for awhile\nwith the Slammers, then I went to Mexico and got injured.\n\nI came back and tried to work for like a year, but it just wasn't working out.\nI was still living at home and my mom said I either had to go to school or\nleave. I didn't want to go back to school, so I decided to pack my bags and\nmove to LA. Now I'm out here and that's kind of where the Tobi Lou stuff\nstarted. I feel like I came out here to figure out how to do what I want to do\nwith music, so I can make my way back to Chicago. Now I'm back and forth\nbetween Chicago and LA.\n\n> I found a joy in talking about sad shit sometimes and having fun being sad.\n\n**Was there a point that you remember finding your style as Tobi Lou?**\n\nFinding my sound and style was kind of tricky. Sometimes to this day, I don't\neven know if I have it. I like to record when I wake up, so I'll just get up\nand go with whatever I'm feeling that day. I feel like I have honed in on it\nbetter, though, and that just took time. I was making music in Chicago, and\nyou know that's such an amazing, soulful, inspirational city. We have so many\namazing artists there with so much soul: Chance, Vic, Saba, Noname, the list\ngoes on and on. But I just felt like any time I made something, I was getting\ncompared to anyone from Chicago and I just wanted to be me.\n\nI always felt different. Kanye West was the reason I started making music.\nWhen I first saw him on the TV and radio, I heard this voice that I'd never\nheard before. When I heard him, I thought, \"Wow, okay, so different people\nlike me are allowed to make music.\"\n\nFrom there, I started using melody more and tried to figure out what my\nrapping style was. I made a song a couple years ago, and I thought I was\nrapping on it, but everyone told me, \"Wow, that's such a good R&B song.\" And\nI'm like, \"Wait, what?\" That song was called \"Game Ova,\" which was the first\nsong that got me any kind of attention. At that point I started honing in on\nmy sound more.\n\n**Lots of your songs are upbeat and fun and give off a positive energy. What\nattracts you to that kind of music?**\n\nWinter in Chicago is terrible. No one really goes outside, and if you're\noutside, everyone's just battling the elements. So you don't really see smiles\nor anything. Then I came to LA in February and it was bright as fuck. I was\nwalking around and it felt so different. Of course it was sunny, but I just\nrealized everyone was smiling, too. I was like, \"What the fuck?\" Then I\nfigured out, oh, that's because they don't have to battle zero degree weather.\n\nSo in LA, I was feeling a vibe of happiness and freedom. I was couch surfing\nat a friends' house, so it was still tough, but when the sun comes up, it\nmakes you feel like you have a chance. I feel like that made me start in my\nlittle quote-unquote \"happy shit\" Tobi Lou stuff.\n\nBut on the other hand, one of my favorite songs is \"Hey Ya!\" by OutKast. Most\npeople don't know that Andre 3000 is talking about the saddest shit on that\nsong, because it's masked with happiness. He's talking about divorce and why\nlove doesn't last and shit, but he's like, \"You don't want to hear me, you\njust want to dance.\" So I found a joy in talking about sad shit sometimes and\nhaving fun being sad. I kind of adopted that in my early stuff. I'm still\ndoing it now, but I do have some sadder sounding shit that isn't as upbeat and\nhappy, too. I just haven't put that out yet.\n\n> Kanye West was the reason I started making music. When I first saw him on\nthe TV and radio, I heard this voice that I'd never heard before. When I heard\nhim, I thought, 'Wow, okay, so different people like me are allowed to make\nmusic.'\n\n**I 'm really impressed with all your visuals. How do approach that side of\nbeing an artist?**\n\nI watched artists like Kanye West and Missy Elliott make videos when I was\nyounger--anybody who really took their time with it. Today you have the same\nwith artists like Kendrick Lamar, Janelle Monae, and Beyonce, but videos used\nto really mean something. It got to the point where they meant less. I mean, I\nfuck with crazy mobbing in the street type videos, too--it's just about what\nfits the vibe. But I always felt that videos were a chance to put everything\ntogether. I always thought they were really important.\n\nGlassface is the key for me being able to unlock the things I do visually.\nWithout him, I couldn't do shit. For videos, I'll have an idea, or sometimes\nhe'll have an idea, and we'll come together. Then he'll take it even further\nwith shit I'd never think about. My mind really thinks musically and I can put\na story together, but the shit he does with my visuals really takes it to\nanother level.\n\nPhoto by @stayneutral\n\n**You 've known Glassface for a long time, right?**\n\nYeah, we met on a Kanye forum. At the time it was called either KanyeTalk or\nKanyeLive. Now it's KanyeToThe. I was posting shit under my first musical\nname, Wonda. He reached out, said he fucked with it, and started doing cover\nart for me. He doesn't do the cover art for me now, though. Right now,\nGoodnight Meesh does that.\n\nShe's actually the reason why my hair is in buns, too. One day, she was\nputting my hair in braids and she always puts it in buns before she separates\nit out. I was looking at it in the mirror and I was like, \"Um, the buns look\nkind of cool.\" I hate getting my hair braided, so we just stopped there. Then\nI went to the beach and got a bunch of crazy looks, but I felt good, because I\nwas the only one like that. But yeah, she's a brilliant artist and created\nLittle Lou basically. I owe it to her and Glassface for bringing my vision\ntogether.\n\n> I want my own cartoon. I want that shit so bad. It's what I'm building\ntowards and why I'm incorporating all these worlds, sort of like _Who Framed\nRoger Rabbit_ , where it blends cartoons and reality.\n\n**I noticed that you use animation a lot in your artwork and videos. Did you\ngrow up watching a lot of cartoons?**\n\nNot only did I grow up watching cartoons, but I still watch that shit. I don't\nknow why, but my mind really reacts to animation. _Hey Arnold!_ was one of my\nfavorite all-time cartoons. I used to love _Doug_. And _Avatar: The Last\nAirbender_ --I like anime, too. I just love animation. There's something about\na world where anything is possible, and it can be as crazy as you want or as\nreal as you want. _BoJack Horseman_ is a really crazy show. I want my own\ncartoon. I want that shit so bad. It's what I'm building towards and why I'm\nincorporating all these worlds, sort of like _Who Framed Roger Rabbit_ , where\nit blends cartoons and reality.\n\nI feel like some people lose that magic when they get older. We're dealing\nwith real shit, so I get it. But even when dealing with real shit, you've\nstill gotta have a sense that anything can happen as if your life is a fuckin'\ncartoon. I really like that shit.\n\n**That 's exactly what you achieve with the video for \"TROOP.\" How did that\ncome together?**\n\nI was high, watching _That '70s Show_ before I fell asleep. Then I woke up and\nsaw the classic smoke circle. I was just watching and thought to myself that\nit would be crazy if I was in the smoke circle with fuckin' cartoons and\nrandom ass shit.\n\nThen I was like, \"Wait, can we do that?\" I always say that, because of course\nyou can do anything, but we don't have money like that. To make things happen,\nwe have to be creative and lean on talented friends. When we shot \"Game Ova,\"\nwe shot it in the arcade where Kid Cudi shot \"Day 'N' Nite.\" To shoot there\nwas a crazy amount of money, so we told them we were in art school and were\nfilming a project. We just have to come up with ways to get shit done.\n\nSo, I hit Glassface up and told him the idea.\"TROOP\" is a song about being by\nyourself, but you can enjoy it and think of it as being with your crew. I made\nit because when I moved out to LA, I was by myself almost every night. I had\nto kind of turn up by myself, smoking or drinking or whatever. I was my own\ntroop. So I'm hallucinating and having a trip and I'm imagining these little\ncartoons and the Kanye bear. Not Kanye, but the Kanye bear. Like, \"Who would\nyou have dinner with out of anyone in the world?\" The Kanye bear. It's just\none crazy trip.\n\n> \"TROOP\" is a song about being by yourself, but you can enjoy it and think of\nit as being with your crew.\n\n**What kind of headspace were you in when you wrote the song?**\n\nI always made music sober. I never got high or drunk when I made music. But\nwhen I finally moved out of my parents' house and was on my own out here, I\nwas kind of in my own space. I would try to smoke or drink a little and make\nmusic, but I was never able to. I would just end up listening to music and\nshit, but never made anything. It would end up just being a little party by\nmyself. As sad as that shit sounds, I was a little depressed and nothing was\ngoing right. I didn't totally know what to do. I was like my own best friend\nand I wasn't really talking to my friends back home.\n\nIt wasn't a fun experience, but that's the headspace I was in. When I say,\n\"When I'm with my troop,\" that's just me being there for myself. In that song,\nI say, \"I've got my hair in buns, bitch I'm cute.\" You know how you change\nyour hair up or you get a new 'fit and your friends hype you up? I was by\nmyself and didn't have those people with me, so I had to be my own confidence\nand build myself up each day while going through that stress.\n\nPhoto by @stayneutral\n\n**The Smino feature is awesome. How did that come together?**\n\nWhen I was in Chicago every day, I would go up to Classick Studios. The owner\nChris \"Classic\" Inumerable is now Smino's manager. I would go up there and do\nsessions with Cam O'bi normally. Chris always fucked with me and we kept in\ncontact over the years. I was a big fan of Smino and when I was singing the\n\"woo woo woo woo\" part of the song, I thought he would sound dope on it. I\ntook a shot in the dark and had Chris send it to him. From what I heard, Smino\nfucked with it immediately and sent it back right away.\n\n**You 've been really busy already this year, dropping lots of music and\nvideos. Are you going to keep that up throughout the year?**\n\nYeah. This year's about coming at the world in a visual manner. It's about the\nmusic, but the music is being delivered by the visuals. I realized that when\nyou post a song, you've kind of got to wait for people to listen. Some people\njust don't have time and they'll get to it later. But when you post a video,\npeople get to that shit. Whether they're watching on silent at work or in a\nclassroom, it's going to catch a lot more people. So I realized that's how I\nhave to deliver the music.\n\nI really loved watching Brockhampton release all those videos last year. I was\nlike, \"Yeah, that's how you do it.\" Fuck everything else. Get people content\nand make sure it's good. With the _tobi lou and the Moon_ series, I put out\nshort videos to lead up to this grand video,  \"TROOP.\" Then we're going to do\nanother series that will lead up to \"NUMBERS,\" which is the next big video.\n\n**I 'll end with a corny ass question that I always like asking: If you had to\ndescribe the ideal setting for someone to hear this song for the first time,\nwhat would it be?**\n\nI feel like an ideal setting would be watching the video. Now that we have a\nvisual, I can't imagine people hearing it without seeing the video. Ideally,\nI'd like you to get home and plug your laptop into your TV with some crazy\nspeakers. Take it in like it was a Friday night and you went to Blockbuster\nafter school or some shit. But honestly, even if people are watching it on\ntheir phones, I think it's going to be an experience no matter what.\n\n","date_published":null,"dek":null,"direction":"ltr","domain":"pigeonsandplanes.com","excerpt":"Watch the premiere of Tobi Lou's Glassface-directed video for \"TROOP\" with Smino.","lang":"en","lead_image_url":"https:\/\/images.pigeonsandplanes.com\/images\/c_crop,h_700,w_1245,x_0,y_0\/f_auto,fl_lossy,q_auto,w_1200\/ghjrmfcjc5fweblhbyzb\/tobi-lou-troop-thumb","next_page_url":null,"pages_rendered":null,"rendered_pages":1.0,"title":"Tobi Lou Is Creating His Own Magical World and He Just Took a Huge Leap Forward","total_pages":1.0,"url":"http:\/\/pigeonsandplanes.com\/discover\/2018\/03\/tobi-lou-interview-troop-video-premiere-smino","word_count":2619},{"author":"b3","content":"January 31, 2018\n\nOut now on B3SCI Records is _Ojai_ , the new EP from Dutch-born L.A. artist\nNick van Hofwegen a\/k\/a Young & Sick.

From Sasha\n& Digweed to Tiefschwarz, there is no shortage of brilliant duos doing their\nthing. Another such name to add to that list is Wayward. Lawrence and Louis\nare a British duo who possess a beautiful, otherworldly sound that's very much\ntheir own, and it's a method of approaching their craft that's quickly winning\nthem friends in high places aplenty. On that note, they've won plaudits\nrecently from a host of the scene's most interesting DJs, and have even had\ntheir work remixed by the likes of Hammer and Man Power. Much like Hammer and\nMan Power, they seem to be following a similar trajectory too. With their\nfirst release of 2018, the magnificent 'Good Afternoon Mr. Magpie' out\nshortly, we decided to pass some quick questions their way\u2026\n\n**WWD: How was the last year for you guys and what were the highlights?**\n\nLawrence: 2017 was a really positive year for us musically and we released\nsome of our best music to date. I think both releases on Silver Bear were\nhighlights, especially getting Man Power and Hammer on the remixes for the\nAlexandra EP. Also, some of the shows we played, alongside Moxie, Jeremy\nUnderground and Chaos in the CBD were really fun too.\n\n**WWD: As musicians, do you make plans and aims? What are your hopes and\ndreams for the year ahead then?**\n\nLawrence: There are always goals, aims and certain things that you want to\ntick off the list. It's what keeps you motivated and focused. In 2018 we're\nlooking forward to having our most productive year in terms of releases and\nwant to continue working as hard as possible in the studio.\n\n**WWD: So \u2026 apart from one another, who would you absolutely love to work\nwith?**\n\nLawrence: D Bridge, The Neptunes, Burial.  \nLouis: Toumani Diabate, Matthew Herbert, Mike Skinner.\n\n**WWD: We 're really loving the new EP. Was there one particular inspiration\nbehind it all?**\n\nLouis: More than anything else we were probably most inspired by our gear and\nthe sounds they make. Our beloved Juno-60 and DSI Tempest feature heavily\nacross all 5 tracks so this really drove the songwriting process on this EP.\nIt was written over the course of last summer, which had its ups and downs.\nThe final track we wrote, Calanques is sort of an ode to our trip to Marseille\nat the tail end of the season. To us, this track feels quite reflective,\nreminiscent of a summer gone.\n\nLawrence: The first track we wrote on the EP was 'Good Afternoon Mr. Magpie'\nand I think this formed the skeleton of the EP and the kind of music we made\nover the summer period. We had planned to create more club ready tracks, but\nsometimes you have to follow what is inspiring you in the studio at that time!\n\n**WWD: Can you tell us a bit about how you both became involved in electronic\nmusic? What motivated you to start producing music in the first place?**\n\nLawrence: From a young age my brother Dan was always in the room next to mine\nat home on Logic or mixing on his 1210s. I'd always hear him creating drum n\nbass breaks and the low rubble of reese bass lines through the walls. Because\nhe was my older brother I wanted a go, using his decks whilst he was out and\nwhen he gave me Logic I haven't really looked back. I've always known I'd want\nto be involved in music in some way but making music on Logic was always what\nmade me the happiest.\n\nLouis: In all honesty, Lawrence was a big influence in me producing electronic\nmusic. Prior to Wayward I had been DJing a lot but only ever used Logic\nsoftware to produce terrible dubstep tunes and record bands.\n\n**WWD: What do you feel are the biggest challenges facing up-and-coming\nproducers at the moment? Do you feel there 's a pressure to be particularly\nvocal on social media, for example?**\n\nLawrence: The sheer volume of producers out there and the difficulty of\ncutting through that is challenging but it does put more emphasis on having\nyour own unique sound which I don't think is a bad thing. Soundcloud changing\nand becoming less accessible has made a difference. It was such a great place\nfor emerging artists to put their music online. There doesn't seem to be a\nspace like that at the moment which definitely makes it harder to get yourself\nout there.\n\nSocial media is important, but nowhere near as important as your music. You\nsee a lot of artists these days who seem to be pros at social media but their\nmusic hasn't got much substance, which is sad. I think the focus should always\nbe on creating and working on your craft, social media will follow that.\n\n**WWD: And what advice would you give to people starting out?**\n\nLouis: Make music for yourself first and foremost. If it means something\nsignificant to you then it's more likely to resonate positively with other\npeople. Going into the studio thinking I wanna make a track like x,y & z so\nthat a, b & c will release it doesn't usually work out too well.\n\n**WWD: So how does it work between you in the studio? Who does what? Is each\nday as different as the next?**\n\nLawrence: We work separately quite a lot and come together when we know we've\ngot an idea that we're both really excited about. I'm more on the production\nside of things and Louis songwriting but we do share roles a lot of the time\nas well. We've now got a live set up with drum machines and synths which has\nmade the studio a really exciting place to work.\n\n**WWD: Do you generally agree on most things musically or have there been\ntimes when you strongly disagreed? What do you do in that sort of scenario?**\n\nLouis: I think it would be counter-productive if we agreed on everything.\nUltimately some of our favourite parts in certain tracks have come from a\ndisagreement, which led to scrapping something and trying again. Of course\nit's difficult at times and only works because there is a good level of trust\nin the collaboration.\n\nLawrence: We fight till one of us calls it quits and lets the other win!\n\n**WWD: And is there a certain piece of kit that you always rely on? Do you\ngenerally make music on laptops or on hardware? Does it matter?**\n\nLouis: We made music just on laptops for a long time and struggled to find the\nsound we were hearing in our heads. We're now almost on a completely analog\nset up and feel like we've finally found the sounds we were searching for. In\nthe last year our studio has grown massively. It obviously doesn't matter when\nyou've got people like Four Tet creating New Energy on just a laptop but\nhardware has a mind of its own sometimes and synths and drum machines can\noften provide a much needed spark when you're starting a tune.\n\n**WWD: And what about your DJ style? Would you say you have a particular\n'style'? And much like production, do you generally just follow the vibe or\nare you more tactical about how you play together?**\n\nLawrence: It has taken us a while to get accustomed to djing together, making\nsure we're both on the same page when building the intensity in our sets and\nalso knowing when to switch it up. Over many years of playing together we have\nlearnt a lot and our sets are now more fluid and exciting. We both enjoy long\nblends and big builds but it's also important to keep adapting your mixing\nstyle sometimes doing quicker cuts and shorter builds to keep the set\ninteresting. It is also all about trying to understand the crowd, imagining\nwhat they'd like to hear next or how far you can push them in a certain\ndirection.\n\n**WWD: Do you have a particularly favourite place to play? If so, what makes\nthat place special?**\n\nLouis: Beaverworks in Leeds. We were running nights up here for 4 years while\nwe were students and had some incredible moments playing in the Warehouse.\nAlso having got to know the team behind the venue, it's really refreshing to\nfind people who are putting on parties for the sake of having a wicked party,\nnot driven by greed or status.\n\n**WWD: You 've enjoyed some great early success with your music. How long did\nit take you to get to a stage where you were confident enough to release\nmusic? Is being confident in your music something you find difficult? Or do\nyou nearly always know when a track is completed?**\n\nLawrence: In the early stages of Wayward the decision to release music was\nkind of made for us and put online by blogs when we'd sent it to them. It is\ndifficult to be confident in your own music but that special feeling when\nsomeone else appreciates your music and is really into it overcomes that fear.\nAs we've become more experienced as producers we now have a method we go\nthrough once we're finished with the writing process which makes it easier to\nfinish tracks off. It'll always be difficult to let go of a track and say it's\ndone but you have to trust your instincts!\n\n**WWD: Aside from one another, who 's been the biggest influence on your work?\nAnd what's the best advice you've ever received?**\n\nLouis: In the short break we took from writing music we made friends with a\nreally good guy called Marc Brown who produced Smoke City. As someone who's a\nseasoned pro in the industry he's full of great advice. His words of wisdom\nhave had an influence on me and he even handed down some gear to us. Big up,\nMarc!\n\nLawrence: My parents have always said to me \"keep creating\" and that has stuck\nwith me from a young age. Biggest influence is pretty tough as their are so\nmany different aspects of life that inspire you. If I were to pick one person\nit would probably have to be my brother, purely because he introduced me to\nelectronic music and I wouldn't be doing what I'm doing if he wasn't for him.\n\n**WWD: And what do you reckon you 'd be doing if you weren't in music?**\n\nLouis: I studied TV Production at Uni and during my final year placement I was\noffered a role at the company. It was a real fork in the road moment for me\nand in the end I chose to pursue music - so had I not been making tunes, I'd\nprobably be working in television.\n\nLawrence: I was working for a music label before I went to uni so maybe\nsomething similar to that. Recently I've been thinking about training as an\nelectrician!\n\n**WWD: Finally, what tracks are really rocking your bag at the moment?**\n\nLouis: Leafar Legov - Ourloveisstrong. I've waited for ages for this to be\nreleased having first heard it and become obsessed with it in Leafar's RA Mix\nin 2016. Feels good to finally hold the record.\n\nLawrence: I've been listening through all of the old autonomic podcasts\nrecently and refound gems like Jimmy Edgar - LBLB Detroit and Arpanet -\nIlluminated Displays.\n\n**Out now on Silver Bear recordings.

Despite the millions of songs at\nour fingertips, there are myriad horrific statistics indicating that [some\nhuge] percentage of listening is focused on [some tiny] percentage of songs.\nThat is, there are entire realms of music, subgenres and sub-sub-genres, that\ngo unheard, musty and stale in the dankest dungeons of Spotify and Apple\nMusic. It could well be the inverse application of age and free time, but I\nswear I used to find so much weird stuff on the Internet. Now, the powers that\nbe have cleaned up the offerings, swept the difficult-to-attribute or ungainly\nlong song titles under a rug and trumpeted only the sanitized, label-approved\nversion of everything. It's sad and wrong and not how I came across Kraak &\nSmaak.\n\nThere was no 'Discover Weekly' or 'Rap Caviar' to autonomously, robotically\nguide me towards what I should like when I first discovered and posted on\nKraak & Smaak back in June of 2009. The way I stumbled upon them was likely\nthe way I stumbled upon everyone outside the mainstream in those days -\nthrough a happy combination of happenstance, curiosity and dumb luck. But the\nrabbit holes of the Internet have mostly been plugged up with corporate goop,\nthe warrens destroyed by the monolithic stomp of curated playlists and\n'Recommended For Yous'. Which makes it that much more exciting to re-engage\nwith the Leiden, Netherlands trio working their magic on a newish track from\nParcels, a band that itself has some unique history.\n\nHow Parcels, a five piece from Byron by way of Berlin, channeling Fleetwood\nMac vibes, came to get the funky treatment from the Dutch trio is beyond me.\nAll I know is that I'm ecstatic that such chance collaborations still have a\nplace in 2017's music landscape and still sound as fresh, unique and sharply\naccretive as they did in their heyday, a decade ago now. If you haven't heard\nParcels' brand of retro-disco before (a distinct possibility given the band\nhasn't released an album yet), that is one lead worth chasing up. But here we\nget the best of two worlds as Kraak & Smaak puts the group through its\nunderstated funky wringer, evoking the best of The Whitest Boy Alive and Peter\nBjorn and John in the process. The track is something that harks back to a\nmore innocent age, when reworks didn't have to be label-sanctioned or even\nartist-approved, as long as the result built by standing on the original's\nshoulders rather than diminished it. So it is with 'Allaround', atmospheric\nand moody, groovy and, most importantly, different.\n\n**Parcels - Allaround (Kraak & Smaak Remix) **  \n\n","date_published":null,"dek":null,"direction":"ltr","domain":"www.1songday.com","excerpt":"Nov 1st, 2017 | posted by: David | With the any-day impending demise of Soundcloud and the contraction of the blogosphere, discovering cool new music in the far-flung corners of the Internet has&hellip;","lang":"en","lead_image_url":null,"next_page_url":null,"pages_rendered":null,"rendered_pages":1.0,"title":"Parcels \u2013 Allaround (Kraak & Smaak Remix)","total_pages":1.0,"url":"http:\/\/www.1songday.com\/2017\/11\/parcels-allaround-kraak-smaak-remix\/","word_count":473},{"author":"Kai Street","content":"Roughly one year ago, we tuned into Roisto's remix of Berlin-based act,\nParcels, and their synth-pop single, _Herefore_.

He first started gaining attention from his 2017 freestyle over Kendrick\nLamar's \"Humble.\" His unique upbringing plays into his brand of music, and his\ncreative new songs \"Ride With Me\" and \"Karma\" are solid examples of such.\n\n\"Ride With Me\" is his most recent track, a day in the life of a rapper. Early\non, he flexes shamelessly about the women in his life. \"I live a wild life\ndon't judge me\/Smoking hella joints in the lobby\/Walk in the room then leave\nwith the girls\/It ain't my fault they wanna fuck me,\" he spits.\n\nThe thumping beat is both light and heavy, and makes the entire song sound\nlike something that could catch on. He also gets off some clever pop culture\nreferences: \"Like 2Pac spitting at the tabloids\/I'm Will Smith hanging with\nthe bad boys\/Get the bag, mask on then we blast off.\"\n\nThe tone of \"Karma\" is a bit different. This track, which also features vocals\nfrom Alex Mali, is an upbeat club jam that nearly transports back to the days\nof 1980's pop. Lyrically, it's straightforward, speaking directly to a woman\nThutmose wishes to grow closer to. \"Nothing in life is for certain\/Close the\ncurtains, follow me baby\/I won't desert you,\" he sings, being as honest as he\ncan. The rest of the song sets a scene of pursuit, leading to things not\nworking out.\n\nListen to Thutmose's \"Ride With Me\" and \"Karma\" below.\n\n**See New Music Releases for March 2018**\n\n","date_published":null,"dek":null,"direction":"ltr","domain":"www.xxlmag.com","excerpt":"Nigerian-born, New York City-living rapper Thutmose has freed two new songs, ''Ride With Me'' and ''Karma.''","lang":"en","lead_image_url":"http:\/\/www.xxlmag.com\/files\/2018\/03\/thutmose-ride-with-me.jpg?w=600&h=0&zc=1&s=0&a=t&q=89","next_page_url":null,"pages_rendered":null,"rendered_pages":1.0,"title":"Thutmose Drops New Songs \"Ride With Me\" and \"Karma\" - XXL","total_pages":1.0,"url":"http:\/\/www.xxlmag.com\/news\/2018\/03\/thutmose-drops-new-songs-ride-with-me-and-karma\/","word_count":259},{"author":"Acid Stag","content":"I've been following Brooklyn artist **Thutmose** since he appeared in my inbox\nabout a year ago, and while I've been loving pretty much everything he's\nreleased since, this new track 'Karma' is taking it to the next level.\n\nHe's teamed up with fellow Brooklynite **Alex Mali** for some heavenly guest\nvocal work, and together they've created a dreamy electro-RnB treat that will\npump you full of feel-good vibes and will have you flying through the weekend.\n\nStream\/Buy: TH3RD BRAIN RECORDS  \nArtist Connect: Facebook | Soundcloud | Twitter | Spotify | Instagram\n\n","date_published":"2018-02-23T00:00:00.000Z","dek":null,"direction":"ltr","domain":"acidstag.com","excerpt":"I\u2019ve been following Brooklyn artist Thutmose since he appeared in my inbox about a year ago, and while I\u2019ve been loving pretty much everything he\u2019s released since, this new track \u2018Karma\u2019 is taking it&hellip;","lang":"en","lead_image_url":null,"next_page_url":null,"pages_rendered":null,"rendered_pages":1.0,"title":"Thutmose \u2013 \u2018Karma\u2019 (ft.

This brings up the idea of\nintuition, which the artist, conscious of the limits of a song, doesn't really\nexplore: he just says 'go with it.'\n\nThe idea is too broad and it may be best to leave it there; because what is\nintuition? Is intuition the 'not-thinking-about-it' Westerman is singing\nabout? Isn't intuition a pattern of behaviours and consequent feelings we have\ndragged from our childhood?\n\nWhatever the debate can be, Westerman's creative effort in this track is\nmarvellous. It marks a progression from his early sound, influenced by the\nlikes of Nick Drake and David Byrne. Westerman's craft has gone beyond these;\nbut as all mentors, he still respects his masters whether he wants it or not,\nand Nick Drake's silky echoes and stupendous lyrics are present in the song.\n\n'Confirmation' continues a string of collaborations with electronic producer\nBullion, which is helping Westerman continue sculpting the big marble of his\nown sound.\n\n**' Confirmation' is out now via Blue Flowers. Westerman is scheduled to\nheadline London's Shacklewell Arms on Wednesday 11th April, tickets are on\nsale now and available here.**\n\n**Photo Credit: ** James Sinclair\n\n**Find Westerman on** _Facebook_ **and** _Twitter_ **.**\n\n","date_published":"2018-02-25T11:51:50.000Z","dek":null,"direction":"ltr","domain":"bittersweetsymphonies.co.uk","excerpt":"Westerman follows up his Call And Response EP with latest single \u2018Confirmation,\u2019 a meditative moment that asks not to \u201cthink so much about it.\u201d","lang":"en","lead_image_url":"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/bittersweetsymphonies.co.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/02\/Westerman-photo-Credit-James-Sinclair.jpeg?fit=1000%2C663&ssl=1","next_page_url":null,"pages_rendered":null,"rendered_pages":1.0,"title":"TRACK OF THE DAY: Westerman \u2013 \u2018Confirmation\u2019","total_pages":1.0,"url":"https:\/\/bittersweetsymphonies.co.uk\/2018\/02\/25\/track-of-the-day-westerman-confirmation\/","word_count":293},{"author":null,"content":"\"Confirmation\" manages to feel warm and icy at the same time, providing a nice\nduality for the listener to melt into.

While his\nfirst two EPs -- 2015's _Slow_ and last year 's _Real_ -- prominently featured\nguitar, his forthcoming album sees him making better use of space, silence,\nand ambiance.\n\n\"I've become obsessed with the idea of creating atmosphere,\" he explained in a\nstatement, \"as I learnt more about production. I found it easier to translate\nmy ideas and find new ways to create the sounds that would reflect my lyrical\nstyle.\" As far as role models for this new atmospheric bent, Green looks to\nproducers like Four Tet, Mount Kimbie, and Bonobo; his dream collaborator is\nGerman producer Nils Frahm.\n\nA bit of Frahm's world makes its way onto Green's latest single, \"Shift\". The\ntrack was pieced together in Berlin at a building called Funkhaus, an old\nbroadcast site that musicians such as Frahm have been using as a recording\nhub. The track itself is electronic-meets-R&B, operating in the same soothing,\nalluring terrain as, say, Rhye. Here, the contrasting moments of quiet\/release\nand vocals\/desire make for the kind of intoxicating listen that transports you\nelsewhere.\n\nThis idea of transporting is a focal point not only for the track but also the\nnew LP, \"The whole album is based around this theme, but none more so than\nthis track,\" Green tells _Consequence of Sound_.  \"Lyrically, 'Shift' refers\nto the sensation of falling, unaware of when you'll reach an end but enjoying\nthe loss of control and feeling of weightlessness.\"\n\nHear the song below.\n\nGreen's debut album, also titled _Shift, _ is due out this March. For this\nedition of Origins, Green further details how Funkhaus and the concept of\nmovement led to the birth of the effort's title track.\n\n**Movement:**\n\nThe whole album is based around this theme, but none more so than this track.\nIt felt like a very natural theme to explore and one that I constantly\ngravitated towards when writing lyrics or describing the evolution of a track.\nI wanted to make the album feel like it was constantly in motion; moving at a\nvariety of paces, pushing and pulling in different ways but always feeling\nlike progression. Lyrically, \"Shift\" refers to the sensation of falling,\nunaware of when you'll reach an end but enjoying the loss of control and\nfeeling of weightlessness.\n\n**Production:**\n\n\"Shift\" was a track that I felt I could experiment with and express myself\nthrough production. Quite a few of my songs are developed in a purely acoustic\nway; pages of words or an afternoon on the guitar\/piano, and the arrangement\nand electronics built up afterwards. But \"Shift\" was created from a few\nproduction ideas, synth patches and beats that I'd programmed. The lyrics were\ninspired by the movement and dynamics in the production and those ultimately\ninspired the album title.\n\n**Funkhaus, Berlin:**\n\nThe foundations of the track were built at home in Bristol, but quite a lot of\nthe arrangement was pieced together in Berlin. I was working at an incredible\nbuilding called Funkhaus, an old radio broadcast site built in the 1950s. It's\nsuch an inspiring place, partly due to the history of it and partly due to the\nmusicians who are now creating there, namely Nils Frahm. Many of the sessions\nI had there would run late in to the night and the ambience and feeling of\nFunkhaus would definitely creep it's way on to the tracks. It definitely\ninspired and influenced the whole album.\n\n","date_published":"2018-02-06T17:30:32.000Z","dek":null,"direction":"ltr","domain":"consequenceofsound.net","excerpt":"UK-based producer finds beauty in Berlin and the concept of movement.","lang":"en","lead_image_url":"https:\/\/consequenceofsound.files.wordpress.com\/2018\/02\/origins.png?w=1200","next_page_url":null,"pages_rendered":null,"rendered_pages":1.0,"title":"Henry Green details the Origins of new single \u201cShift\u201d: Stream","total_pages":1.0,"url":"https:\/\/consequenceofsound.net\/2018\/02\/henry-green-details-the-origins-of-new-single-shift-stream\/","word_count":604},{"author":null,"content":"__September 29, 2017 2017-09-29T12:53:26+00:002017-09-29T12:54:03+00:00\n__Chill, Music, Urban\n\nPost Malone's new single went straight to Nr 1 in several countries (next\nweek), every Streaming service and whatnot, and all that within 2 weeks.

Then, a few days\nlater, he headed to New York to work on music with his friend Christian Combs\nand had a chance encounter with Post.\n\n\"Post Malone was in another studio room close by,\" Tank says. \"We ended up\ncrossing paths and I asked him if I could play some beats. He said, 'Let's get\nweird,' so I played him that beat and the rest is history.\"\n\nExplaining that the song's heavy 808s shook the whole room when he pressed\nplay, Tank says Post was impressed with the production as soon as he heard it\nand started singing \"I feel just like a rock star\" right away. From there, he\nfleshed out the rest of the song with references to rock legends like Bon\nScott and Jim Morrison.\n\n\"It's a lifestyle,\" Post tells P&P. \"We are the new rockstars! It was\nimportant to pay respect to the legends.\"\n\nBy the end of the night, he had recorded a full draft of the track and\nuploaded a snippet to Twitter from the studio, but the song was still missing\nsomething.\n\n\"We knew it needed someone,\" Post explains. \"I just felt 21 Savage would bring\nthat attitude which is exactly what the song needed.\u200b\"\n\nAfter some finishing touches from engineer Louis Bell, the song was finally\nreleased on September 15. Within a week, Post had the highest charting single\nof his career. Listen to the final product below and continue for our full\nconversation with Tank God.\n\n**When did you first make the \"Rockstar\" beat and how did it end up in Post's\nhands?**\n\nI made the beat in college at the University of Hartford in Connecticut last\nDecember. Then I went to New York to go to my boy Christian Combs' studio\nsession. Post Malone was in another studio room close by. We ended up crossing\npaths and I asked him if I could play some beats. He said, \"Let's get weird,\"\nso I played him that beat and the rest is history.\n\n**When you sat down to make the beat, what were you going for?**\n\nTo me, the melodies are really dark. I was going through a lot of stress. It\nwas finals week and I had literally just taken three finals after studying all\nday. And I was like, \"I need to get my mind off this stuff.\" So I sat down and\nmade three beats. And that was one of them. Then three days later, I went to\nNew York and played it for Post.\n\n\ufeff **Do you know what specifically he liked about the beat?**\n\nIt's hard to move Post, but I think it was the 808s in the song that got him.\nThe studio was so loud that it shook the whole room when I played it. I think\nthat's what it was.\n\n**Were you in the studio when Post recorded his part?**\n\n\ufeffPost recorded a draft of the whole song right there on the spot. You know,\nlike most artists do, he later finalized it and sharpened it and added a\nfeature. So now it's this big record. But he did the rough recording the first\nday right after I played it for him.\n\nTank God\n\n**What was the vibe like in the studio when he recorded that?**\n\n\ufeffEverybody was shocked at how fast everything came together and how random it\nall was. But it was definitely a party vibe.\n\n**At the beginning of the song, is that eerie laugh a recording of Post? Or is\nthat a sample?**\n\n\ufeffYeah, that's Post. [ _Laughs_ ]\n\n**Did the beat go through many changes after you first played it for Post?**\n\n\ufeffNah, nothing really changed. Just the outro. That's it.\n\n**The song is obviously full of references to old rockstars and plays up some\nof Post 's background in rock. Do you know what made him want to make a song\nabout rockstars?**\n\n\ufeffYo, I can't even say. He was just bouncing ideas around and that's what he\ncame up with, just singing \"I feel just like a rockstar.\" And after that, he\njust started building around it.\n\n**Do you listen to much rock music?**\n\n\ufeffYeah, I listen to all genres, because you never know how you can incorporate\nit into your sounds. I don't listen to a lot of rock, but when you're with\nPost, obviously you're going to be listening to a lot of that.\n\n**Do you know where the idea for getting 21 on the song came from? Or why Post\nwanted him?**\n\n\ufeffI don't know. It was just one day, someone was like, \"Yo, 21 might be on it.\"\nThen the next day 21 was on it. That was some crazy shit.\n\n**\ufeff The song is already really successful and breaking records. If you were to\nguess, why do you think this song is connecting with people so well?**\n\nIt's a different vibe that's not out right now. There's no vibe like\n\"Rockstar.\"\n\n**So, Post has obviously been making a lot of music lately, getting his album\ntogether. Why do you think this song, specifically, made sense to release\nfirst?**\n\n\ufeffBecause it's a hit. [ _Laughs_ ] Nah, it was just a great record and the\nwhole team loved it. So, why not put it out. We've been waiting for so long.\n\n**What else do you have on the horizon? What should people be looking out for\nfrom you?**\n\nI can't talk much about what's coming out, but I do have some things in store\nand I'm excited to put it out and let the whole world listen to it.\n\nYou can hear Tank God's recently released _Tank God_ mixtape below.\n\n","date_published":null,"dek":null,"direction":"ltr","domain":"pigeonsandplanes.com","excerpt":"How a beat made by a biology major during finals week turned into a record-breaking hit.","lang":"en","lead_image_url":"https:\/\/images.pigeonsandplanes.com\/images\/c_crop,h_372,w_661,x_38,y_20\/f_auto,fl_lossy,q_auto,w_1200\/e3qpjhjw8kwhg8yh4uf8\/pm-republic-press","next_page_url":null,"pages_rendered":null,"rendered_pages":1.0,"title":"The Making of Post Malone and 21 Savage's \"Rockstar\"","total_pages":1.0,"url":"http:\/\/pigeonsandplanes.com\/in-depth\/2017\/09\/post-malone-21-savage-rockstar-making-of","word_count":1017},{"author":"Max Weinstein","content":"Post Malone's new single \"Rockstar\" with 21 Savage dropped Sept. 15, and\naccording to a new report from The Verge, the song has broken Apple Music's\nsingle-week streaming record with 25 million plays.

This podcast features exclusive KEXP in-\nstudio performances, unreleased songs, and recordings from independent artists\nthat our DJs think you should hear. Today's song, featured on The Midday Show\nwith Cheryl Waters, is \"Tinseltown Swimming in Blood\" by **Destroyer** , from\nthe 2017 album _ken_ on Merge Records\/Dead Oceans.\n\n**Destroyer - Tinseltown Swimming in Blood (MP3)**\n\nEarlier this year, Canadian supergroup **The New Pornographers** released\ntheir seventh full-length _Whiteout Conditions_. It was the band 's first ever\nalbum without Dan Bejar, the enigmatic wild-haired singer\/songwriter who also\nrecords under the name **Destroyer**. In an interview with _Stereogum_ , New\nPornographers founder\/frontman A.C. Newman explains: \"he was right in the\nmiddle of doing a Destroyer record which was something we'd narrowly skirted\nfor our whole career. I'm always amazed that we managed to. Sometimes we\navoided Destroyer, sometimes Destroyer avoided us, but eventually, we hit at\nthe same time.\" This past Friday, that record was released: Bejar's 12th solo\nalbum _ken_.\n\nFor _ken_ , Bejar found inspiration in the 1994 single \"The Wild Ones\" by UK\nglam-rock group **Suede**. He explains:  \"Sometime last year, I discovered\nthat the original name for 'The Wild Ones' (one of the great English-language\nballads of the last 100 years or so) was 'Ken.' I had an epiphany, I was\nphysically struck by this information. In an attempt to hold on to this\nfeeling, I decided to lift the original title of that song and use it for my\nown purposes. It's unclear to me what that purpose is, or what the connection\nis. I was not thinking about Suede when making this record. I was thinking\nabout the last few years of the Thatcher era. Those were the years when music\nfirst really came at me like a sickness, I had it bad. Maybe 'The Wild Ones'\nspeaks to that feeling, probably why Suede made no sense in America. I think\n'ken' also means 'to know.'\"\n\nDestroyer is embarking on a massive world tour, which includes a Thursday,\nFebruary 8th date at the Neptune Theatre. Follow him on Facebook to see the\nentire itinerary. Below, watch a clip for today's featured track: director\nKaren Zolo (aka KC) delivers a remake of the 1962 French sci-fi classic _La\nJet ee_, written and directed by artist Chris Marker. Like the original film,\nthe video is constructed entirely out of still black-and-white photographs.\nVia a statement, she explains:\n\n> \"I'd just had a conversation about artist Chris Marker with a friend when I\nwas approached to make a music video for the upcoming Destroyer album. 'You\nhave a month.' Okay\u2026 I had no idea what the song even sounded like, but the\nonly idea I had was to remake Chris Marker's _La Jet ee_, as faithfully as\npossible. It's not just an homage to the great cine-poet, it's also about the\nmedium of film, about still photography. It would have been a billion times\neasier and less stressful to shoot it digitally, but it was worth it.\"\n\n","date_published":"2017-10-26T00:00:00.000Z","dek":null,"direction":"ltr","domain":"blog.kexp.org","excerpt":"Every Monday through Friday, we deliver a different song as part of our Song of the day podcast subscription.

The vocals\nattractively rest atop those instruments with a half-whispered perception of\ncurrent reality. Then, there are instruments that drift in as if they escaped\nfrom another genre. The first sustained drift occurs at about 1:40, when the\nguitar begins wondering around until it is blown to the wayside by an eerie\nwind at 2:07.\n\nThe song is from Loma, a supergroup formed of Emily Cross and Dan Duszinsky\n(from Cross Record) and Jonathan Meiburg (from Shearwater). They are from\nDripping Springs, Texas. \"Relay Runner\" is one of ten tracks from an upcoming\nself-titled album. The album is scheduled for release via Sub Pop on February\n16, 2018. Loma will visit San Francisco on April 11, 2018, when they will be\nat the Bottom of the Hill.\n\nQuoting Johnathan Meiburg:\n\n\"'Relay Runner' was the happiest accident on the record. We discovered it when\nwe wired up a tremolo pedal the wrong way, and got this funny, stuttering loop\n- and then we built a whole song around that sound. The last thing we did in\nthe mix was erase the loop, which had gone from inspiring the song to ruining\nit!

This podcast features exclusive KEXP in-\nstudio performances, unrealeased songs, and recordings from independent\nartists that our DJ's think you should hear. Today's song, featured on the\nMorning Show with John Richards, is \"Saltwater\" by **Geowulf** from the 2016\ncompilation _Odd Numbers Volume 1_ released by 37 Adventures.\n\n**Geowulf - Saltwater (MP3)**  \nAs we fully enter autumn in the Northwest, it's still a good time for some\nsummer sounds. New duo Geowulf have released \"Saltwater\" as a reminder that\nsunshine and ocean are internal states of being regardless of season changes.\nStar Kendrick and Toma Banjanin are based between London, Gothenburg and\nBerlin, by way of Australia. This sunny, dream-pop duo looks to bathe the\nlistener in warm, hazy tones and it's easy to give in.\n\nSynths, chiming guitars and a straight forward beat anchor \"Saltwater\" in its\ngroove, yet allow plenty of room for Kendrick's strong, sugary vocals. One can\nimagine a particularly memorable sunset in Geowulf's home country of Australia\nas the track gets in rhythm. The band makes pure comfort music in the vein of\nMazy Star, Starflyer 59 and echoes of Mojave 3. With their combination of\nkeyboards and reverby guitar riffs they create melancholy, sunshine rock that\nisn't afraid of reaching for large soundscapes. The healing nature of the sea\nis apparent in these and so many other artistic works. Geowulf bring us to\nthat simple joy and contemplative peace that comes to us through the ocean.\n\nGeowulf are just getting started and have very recently signed to the label 37\nAdventures. The track is pulled from the recently-released 37 Adventures\ncompilation, _Odd Numbers Volume 1_, but hopefully we'll be hearing more from\nGeowulf soon. It's gonna be fun to see what they have to offer us next. Look\nfor any upcoming news on their Facebook page and check out the video for\n\"Saltwater\" below.\n\nThis entry was posted in KEXP, Song of the Day Podcast and tagged Geowulf.\nBookmark the permalink.

Anchored by the songwriting duo of Bill Lennox and Bobby\nColombo, _Bonny Doon_ was one of 2017's most inviting and relatable albums.\nThe Detroit indie rock band imbued humor and despondency into its 11 laid back\nsongs that never allowed their cleverness cloud their heart. Lennox's \"I See\nYou\" was a boozy meditation on getting a year older that mentions, receiving\nan emoji-laced text from your mom: (\"And the other one was a smiley face, a\nsideways heart, xoxo  \n\/ 'We miss you won't you come on home?'\") while Colombo's \"What Time Is It In\nPortland?\" read like a heartbreaking text to an ex who moved away.\n\nThough that album was full of standouts, Bonny Doon's forthcoming follow-up\n_Longwave_ , out March 23 via Woodsist, improves on the homespun charm that\nmade their debut so inviting. The leap is partially due to the fact that the\nband is more confident now as their debut's songs were just the first songs\nLennox ever wrote, but as Lennox explains over the phone, it also comes from a\nmore cohesive vision. He says, \"The whole goal of this new album was to try\nand capture the band's sound at its essence with everything stripped down and\nvulnerable. We were trying to just capture the sound of the band in a room. We\nwere happy to just kind of bear more of ourselves and be more open.\"\n\nWritten of over the course of a trip to a lake house in Northern Michigan, and\nrecorded at Key Club Studios downstate, the mesmerizing songs on _Longwave_\nare patient enough to ruminate on a musical idea without meandering. It's this\nlack of urgency that has given the band the lyrical space to perfectly capture\ntwenty-something malaise. Though the previously shared single \"I Am Here (I Am\nAlive)\" found Lennox frustrated, \"Is there something missing I can't tell \/ Is\nthere more I can't see,\" Bonny Doon's latest, \"A Lotta Things,\" which Noisey\nis premiering below, encapsulates that sentiment more intensely.\n\nOn the track, Lennox finds time to joke amidst his overwhelming uncertainty,\nsinging, \"I'm faking my own death so I can get rest \/ I know, I thought of\neverything.\" Over bright acoustic guitars and an ambling electric lead, he\nsummarizes his feelings, \"and I should be happy \/ but I'm not, but I'm not.\"\nLennox explains, \"What I like about it is it's just a simple statement, like a\nfeeling of this sort of cosmic uncertainty that a lot of people I know are now\nexperiencing in their mid-to-late twenties. We're always looking for more\nfulfillment and to feel more free.\"\n\nWhere Lennox's laconic delivery echoes the best moments from frontmen like\nDavid Berman and Bill Callahan, comparisons the band welcomes, and Bobby\nColombo's casual drawl evokes Jeff Tweedy's early ouvre, the resonance comes\nthrough their seamless lyrical collaboration. Lennox says, \"On this record, we\nwrote so much together just passing lyrics back and forth. Sometimes at shows\nor in practice, we'll switch it up. I'll sing his songs and he'll sing mine.\nIt makes it fun and also changes the song's perspective in a fresh way.\"\n\nThis fluidity is what keeps Bonny Doon going and what makes their songs some\nof the most refreshing additions to the 2018 indie rock landscape. Forever\ncurious, Lennox muses, \"The album is definitely a journey inward for both my\nsongs and Bobby's songs. It's really cohesive in that way. There's a whole\naspect of acknowledging parts of the self: what they are, what they could be,\nand what can be better.\"\n\nPreorder _Longwave_ , which is out March 23 via Woodist, here.  \n\n _Josh Terry is a writer in Chicago.

Boy leaves the beaten path to tour, with\nonly a quick rendezvous in an uncomfortable hotel to hyphenate the endless\nweeks on the road. Boy's album debuts on NPR.

Joy's previous singles (and more than most\nsongs in heavy Indie rotation, for that matter), it excels at telling the\nstory through its instrumentation as much as through its lyrics. Even the most\nwhimsical of folk-pop instruments, the ukulele Quinn strums in solitude to\nstart the song, cannot hold off his deepest insecurities, with a brooding and\nall-consuming bass accompanying his brooding and all-consuming doubts as he\nasks, \"Did I ever want love? Or did I ask too much?\" The ending grows manic,\nwith a staccato guitar piercing through the noise as the voice in the back of\nQuinn's head continues to pierce through his every thought.\n\nAnd then it ends, all at once. Nothing is in his control. \"Is it any wonder\nour love isn't what we thought it was?\" he asks, knowing that there was\nnothing to be done. \"You can't control who you really are, what you really\nwant.\" The sudden end leaves an enormous question mark on the future, but it's\ncertain that Mt.

Yet it 's her latest\nsong _Love You Better_ that has suddenly seen a flurry of interest on line.\nOver the last couple of weeks I 've noticed a number of blogs that I visit\nsuch as Crack In The Road, Too Many Blogs and Going Solo all posting the song\nand it's easy to understand why. _Love You Better_ has a fully-grown\ncompleteness to it. It 's a guitar-based pop tune, but the sort of classic\nthoughtful pop song you might find being played out on BBC Radio 2 rather than\nRadio 1.  \n  \nIt's probably fair to say that on first listen _Love You Better_ probably isn\n't the sort of track that you'd expect interpretive dancing (or in fact\ndancing of any kind) to be done to, but you'd be wrong. The video, which was\nreleased today, features exactly that and it's surprising how well it works.  \n  \nOf the song Emma says: \"It's an interesting song, that can be viewed in two\ndifferent ways. The lyrics \"I can love you better in the long run\" have\njuxtaposing meanings - \"I'll become a better person\" or \"I'm better than that\nperson\". It says a lot about the attitude of an individual in love.\"  \n  \nHaving received a PRS Foundation Women Make Music grant in 2017 Emma has been\nworking with the likes of Grammy Award winning Jimmy Hogarth and Brit School\nalumni Jackson and Rhiannon Mair to develop her work.

Her previous releases such as  'The\nJudgement' and 'Sit With Me', were picked up by the likes of BBC Introducing\nwho made it their track of the week and Dermot O'Leary on Radio 2. Since then,\nshe's been hard at work grafting on tracks and networking around town. PRS for\nMusic, soon recognised her as an artist with a future awarding her the\nprestigious 'Women make Music' grant last year.\n\nNow with continued support from Balcony TV, Radio X and Sofar Sounds, the\nyoung Londoner is back on the scene with an EP that's - to use a cliche - way\nbeyond her years.\n\nThe first single is the warm and emotive 'Love You Better' and fans of **Tash\nSultana** will want to get amongst this. Beach-vibes guitar licks provide the\nfoundation for Emma 's soulful and rich vocal line. The track builds with a\nsad melancholy, then expertly delivers a groove towards the tail end of the\ntrack. Sublime work from the young songwriter.\n\n_\" It's an interesting song, that can be viewed in two different ways. The\nlyrics \"I can love you better in the long run\" have juxtaposing meanings -\n\"I'll become a better person\" or \"I'm better than that person\". It says a lot\nabout the attitude of an individual in love.\"_\n\n**LIVE DATES:**\n\nMon 5 February - Wylam Brewery, Newcastle Upon Tyne Tue 6 February - O2\nAcademy 2 Liverpool, Liverpool Wed 7 February - Tivoli, Buckley Fri 9 February\n- Westgate Hall, Canterbury Sat 10 February - O2 Academy Islington, London Mon\n12 February - Concorde 2, Brighton Tue 13 February - Waterfront, Norwich Wed\n14 February - The Fleece, Bristol Thu 15 February - O2 Academy Oxford, Oxford\nFri 16 February - The Brook, Southampton Sat 17 February - The Junction,\nCambridge\n\nWed 28 February - The Mermaid, St. Albans\n\n","date_published":"2018-02-07T13:45:01.000Z","dek":null,"direction":"ltr","domain":"toomanyblogs.co.uk","excerpt":"Emma McGrath has been writing since a young age and has been releasing some high quality stuff since 2014.

With Taylor still in her late teens, the track and its associated\nmemories are still crystal clear as she recalls her nervous energy over a\nsteady strum of resonant acoustic guitar strings that are layered over a hook\nof squeaky, childlike glee. A brimming, exuberant track, it's a single that\nmakes light of the situation, played to the honest charm of UPSAHL's\nstorytelling prose. Speaking about the inspiration and production aspects of\nher track, including the fact she recorded in a bathroom for that echoing\nresonance, a particularly verbose UPSAHL had this to say about the track:\n\n> _\" It is a modern take on a classic first date. Everything is going great,\nthe chemistry is there, but the kiss just isn't happening. I remember going on\na first date when I was in high school and thinking, 'I'm not going to leave\nthis date without kissing this guy.' I'm a very determined and driven person,\nso once I get my mind set on something, I can't let it go. I feel like this\nsong captures how I felt throughout the date, and probably how a lot of people\nfeel when they first spend time with someone that they are into._\n\n>\n\n>  _The song stems from a voice memo recording that I had on my phone, simply\nof the opening guitar line. I recorded it in my bathroom (good acoustics) a\nfew days before the session. We actually used the exact phone recording as the\nguitar track that carries throughout the whole song, which gives the song a\nlo-fi vibe. This vibe created a pop\/alternative\/grunge-influenced record that\nI 'm really excited about. It's definitely different from any other song I've\nreleased before, and I want to continue this trend as I release new music\nthroughout the year. I'm young and constantly growing. Everyday I feel a\ndifferent way, am into different things, or want to make a certain kind of\nmusic, so I want my sound to reflect this continuous growth. Kiss Me Now\nembodies a sound that I want to continue developing._\n\n>\n\n>  _When writing this song, we wanted it to tell a clear story that everyone\ncould relate to, using specific nouns to create a visual setting in the\nlistener 's mind. 'My dinner's getting cold. How does everything taste like\nheaven? Your drink is warm. It's been a while sipping on ginger ale and a\nwater. I'm running out of refills baby.' The song opens with me and this\nperson sitting in a restaurant on a first date. The conversation is dying down\na little and it's time for the classic first date kiss, but this person isn't\npulling through, even with all the chances I'm giving them. Then we get into\nthe pre-choruses where I describe different scenarios I've been in; the\ntension is there, but the kiss isn't. The chorus of this song is so dancy and\nbadass- I really wanted it to empower people, especially women, to speak their\nminds and not take life too seriously, especially when it comes to a shitty or\neven a decent first date. Long story short, I eventually got my first kiss,\nAND got a pretty rad song out of it that I can't wait for people to hear and\ndance to.\"_\n\nThe tale behind UPSAHL's latest is featured alongside a little date night\ndrama with Taylor in charge and seeing fit.

Taylor Upsahl's music as UPSAHL functions similarly, as it taps\ninto the sweet spot between unfettered innocence and the complicated\ncourtships of adulthood we can't help but approach with the optimism of a\nsophomore. That makes sense, as UPSAHL, who's only just out of high school,\nteeters on the verge of being a grown-up. Of course, one never truly achieves\nadulthood until they realize just how much of their adolescent self remains\nwrapped around their heart.\n\nWhen UPSAHL sings of \"giving you one more chance\" on her new single, \"Kiss Me\nNow\", she's singing not from a broken heart or a shattered will, but from a\nplace of relatable yearning. All she wants is a kiss from the boy with whom\nshe's on a first date, but he's not taking the hint. Maybe he's not\ninterested, or maybe he's just extremely awkward; either way, UPSAHL is\n\"always on the move\" so it's now or never. Whether you're 15 or 50, the\nanticipation of that telepathic dovetail remains the same, as does the\nconviction that there is such a thing as the perfect moment (and that perfect\nmoments pass).\n\nAs on her previous single, \"Can You Hear Me Now\", \"Kiss Me Now\" grounds\nUPSAHL's modern pop sensibilities with splashes of acoustic guitar that\nheighten the song's innate humanity amidst its bright, infectious beat.\nUpsahl's bold, expressive vocals pair mellifluously with Max Frost's\nproduction, resulting in a sweet, upbeat banger suited for even the dimmest\nset of starry eyes.\n\nStream \"Kiss Me Now\" below.\n\nFor more on what influenced UPSAHL to pen \"Kiss Me Now\", check out her\nbreakdown of its Origins below. A movie, a songwriter, and a real-life\nexperience are among them. Also, stay tuned for the song's music video, which\nis due to drop, appropriately, on Valentine's Day.\n\n**Red:**  \nAs a person and a creator, I love bright colors, and the idea of associating a\nspecific color with a song or idea is really important to me in music. I\ndefinitely don't have synesthesia, where you hear colors, but I still think\nthat everyone can relate to this condition in one way or another. For \"Kiss Me\nNow\", I immediately think of the color red. You picture lips, you see red. You\npicture kissing, red. And if you picture me, irritated on a first date because\nhe isn't making a move, you see red. I utilized the significance of this color\nwhen creating a theme for my music video, which comes out on Valentine's Day.\n\n**First date:**  \nWhen writing songs, I typically put myself in other people's shoes to channel\na feeling or situation, but this song very literally happened to me. I was on\na first date with this guy I was really into. I'm a very outgoing person who\nknows what I want, so going into the date, I knew that I wasn't going to leave\nwithout my first kiss. I feel like everyone can relate to the feeling of being\nwith a new person, not taking anything too seriously, but just trying to have\na good time, so I wanted to put this feeling into a song that everyone could\nvibe with and understand.\n\n**_Never Been Kissed_ :**\n\nOne of my favorite movies is _Never Been Kissed_ , with Drew Barrymore. At the\nend of the movie, when she waits on the baseball field for Sam to come and\nkiss her, you can literally feel the anxiety\/excitement\/butterflies that she's\nfeeling in the film. I wanted this song to embody this feeling that a lot of\npeople my age can relate to. Drew's character in the film allows herself to be\ncompletely vulnerable and puts herself at risk of embarrassment for this kiss.\nAlthough \"Kiss Me Now\" is meant to be a fun, light-hearted track, I think it\nalso shows immense vulnerability, which is empowering in a way.\n\n**Julia Michaels:**\n\n  \nJulia Michaels is one of the most talented songwriters of our time, and I\nreally look up to her as a writer, musician, and artist. I feel like some\nwriters try to over complicate lyrics, and this sometimes causes the meaning\nof what they intended to say to be lost. Julia says it how it is, and I think\nthat is why people gravitate towards her writing. It's very conversational,\nrelatable, and understandable, and the way everything is delivered has a\ncertain swagger to it that makes everyone want to listen to what she's saying.\nWhen writing \"Kiss Me Now\", I had a similar outlook on it, so I put the\nlistener in the perspective of the person I was on the date with, using\npronouns like \"you\" throughout. I think the song is candid and conversational,\nwhich makes it really fun to perform.\n\n","date_published":"2018-02-08T18:25:21.000Z","dek":null,"direction":"ltr","domain":"consequenceofsound.net","excerpt":"A confident, doe-eyed paean to the anticipation of a first kiss from a talented artist just months out of high school.","lang":"en","lead_image_url":"https:\/\/consequenceofsound.files.wordpress.com\/2018\/02\/upsahl.jpg?quality=80","next_page_url":null,"pages_rendered":null,"rendered_pages":1.0,"title":"Rising indie-pop artist UPSAHL shares the Origins of her new single, \u201cKiss Me Now\u201d: Stream","total_pages":1.0,"url":"https:\/\/consequenceofsound.net\/2018\/02\/rising-indie-pop-artist-upsahl-shares-the-origins-of-her-new-single-kiss-me-now-stream\/","word_count":820},{"author":null,"content":"The vocals in \"Wild Horses\" are intriguing and captivating, while the glitchy,\npoppy background dances confidently behind them.

This is largely due to the fact that Lott obscures the\npersonal for the universal. As Son Lux has grown to include not only Lott but\nguitarist Rafiq Bhatia and drummer Ian Chang, both talented\nmusicians\/composers in their own right, that opaque quality has become more\nlogical as the music could now be rooted to the collective experience of the\ntrio. Lott has managed to avoid the distraction of personal mystery that is\nstill incredibly poignant and sincere. But something changed around the time\nof the US election. He didn't say at the time but his response to the growing\nunrest not only in the US but the world over stirred something in him and\n_Remedy_ , a four song EP whose proceeds were all donated to SPLC, was the\nresult. But if I've learned anything from Ryan Lott, he always has more than\nand so several months later, we've gotten \"Dream State\", the first single from\nan upcoming Son Lux record that'll see its release early next year.\n\n_Brighter Wounds_ was written in the same head space as _Remedy_ but with much\nmore personal stakes: bringing a new life into the world in the form of his\nnewborn son as well as watching cancer usher a friend out of it, _Brighter\nWounds_ is set to be Son Lux 's most revealing album and \"Dream State\" doesn't\ndisappoint. Without the context of its creation, \"Dream State\" is still as\neffortlessly arresting as any Son Lux song. Compositionally, the trio is still\noperating at the peak performance they honed in on as a live band touring\nbehind _Lanterns_ before Bhatia and Chang actually entered the fold on\n_Bones_. Everything begins subtly as Lott reminisces of times before having to\nwonder about how the future will play out.  \"We knew we were impervious no\nmatter how we bleed\", Lott croons, encapsulating the invincibility and hope of\nyouth and as the song marches on with it's rush of shout vocals, the lyrics\ngradually change to reflect the newfound doubt and care. And yet much like\n\"Change Is Everything\" there is an overwhelming sense of hope that not only\ncatapults the song but weathers the shifting landscape and contorted lyricism\nof \"Dream State\". Lott isn't a pessimist and never has been much for that sort\nof thinking and he's obviously taking stock of his new reality without sinking\nin to despair about it.\n\nMuch like Deerhoof's brilliant and political _Mountain Moves_ , Son Lux are\nfirmly of the opinion that even as things get unforeseeably worse that there\nare brighter times ahead. \"Out of the dark day, into the brighter night\" Lott\nand his choir of voices sing at the climax and its deeply felt. Things are\nuncertain now and uncertain as we age and wrestle with real responsibilities\nand real tragedies but in that uncertainly lies the glittering beacon of hope\nthat things will right themselves in the end. It just might take a long,\nsobering look into the darkness and an unexpected amount of fortitude before\nit's possible.\n\nListen\/Watch the beautiful lyric video of \"Dream State\" directed by frequent\ncollaborators The Made Shop:\n\n_Brighter Wounds_ , the fifth full length studio album from Son Lux, is out\nFebruary 9th on City Slang. You can pre-order the record now.\n\n  \n\n","date_published":"2018-06-05T12:21:00.000Z","dek":null,"direction":"ltr","domain":"all-aroundsound.blogspot.com","excerpt":"Despite the occasional obtuseness of Ryan Lott's lyricism, Son Lux , the project of the now Los Angeles based composer\/producer, has had ...","lang":"en","lead_image_url":"https:\/\/2.bp.blogspot.com\/-zHtQdjC6fBY\/WeKEJXoIBkI\/AAAAAAAACK0\/if1DSwVjUjUo9q5oXyzLWO2KeZnUzcwaQCLcBGAs\/w1200-h630-p-k-no-nu\/Son%2BLux.jpg","next_page_url":null,"pages_rendered":null,"rendered_pages":1.0,"title":"Listen\/Watch: Son Lux - \"Dream State\"","total_pages":1.0,"url":"http:\/\/all-aroundsound.blogspot.com\/2017\/10\/listenwatch-son-lux-dream-state.html","word_count":573},{"author":null,"content":"\"boy.\" opens up with gorgeous, lush, warm synths welcoming you into the track.\nIt slowly builds upon itself until the beat drops, and when it does, \"boy.\"\nseems to lift you off your chair or the ground, ascending you to the heavens\nrapidly, clouds breezing past you and grazing your face as you speed towards\nthe light.

A song inspired by personal experiences with cat calling and a struggle\nwith an eating disorder, it sends a hugely empowering message.\n\n_\" One morning, while I was walking to the USC practice rooms on South\nFigueroa, I got aggressively cat called about my \"fat ass.\" I'm a fiery\nperson. I talk back. I'm \"sassy\" and I'm not shy around strangers. I'm\ntypically not someone who is great at \"taking the higher road\" or letting\nthings go, but in that situation, I felt like a delicate flower. When a man\nconfronts you without batting an eyelash, verbally scrutinizing your body, you\nfeel like nothing. This man was asserting his dominance over me, letting me\nknow that he was entitled to my body -- looking, commenting, maybe even\ntouching. So, I went inside the practice rooms with my face red and hot. I\ngrew up in New York City. This was not the first time I had been cat called on\na street corner, but for some reason it particularly bothered me that day. It\nwas kind of a perfect storm because I felt like I wanted to yell or cry or\nsomething, and I had literally just stepped into a practice room with a piano.\nI started saying things that I wanted to hear -- \"I got my power,\" \"this body\nis my home\" etc. Looking back on that experience, I guess writing the song was\nmy way of getting my power back in the moment._\n\n_I recovered from an eating disorder in the summer of 2016, which is when I\nwrote this song. My whole life I grew up completely buying into the media 's\ndefinition of beauty. I thought that I needed to be rail thin (not my body\ntype) and utterly despised any fat on my stomach. I started my first diet\naround the age of ten, and my battle with food, guilt, and self loathing\ncontinued on throughout the next ten+ years. For me, performing \"This Body\" is\na reminder to myself that I'm sexy and I'm beautiful and I have all of my\nconfidence. That's why I start every show with it. It's not just like I'm\ntelling these lyrics to other people, but I'm sort of talking to myself as\nwell._\n\n_My sophomore year of college, I was extremely lucky in that so many positive\nelements aligned themselves in my life. I had a boyfriend who loved my body\nand reassured me while I put on much needed weight and got increasingly\nhealthier. I moved into an apartment with friends who were like family and\nwere more supportive than I could have ever hoped for. That year, I also found\nthe body positivity movement on social media. I read articles and watched\nvideos of women talking about the stuff I had never been able to articulate\nand would never have felt comfortable articulating. All of these factors in my\nlife came together and really allowed me to grow and to love myself. That kind\nof opened a door for me and inspired me to write about being a woman in very\nliteral terms._\n\n_Honestly, my hope for this song is just that someone, somewhere can listen to\nit and feel what I feel hearing powerful women talk about loving themselves.\nWhen I see a quote that makes smile or a picture of someone owning their body,\nI feel companionship, knowing that we 're all in it together, and I feel\nempowered myself. If I can do that for someone else, then I will know I have\naccomplished something huge.\"_\n\nSounds like: Adele, Austra, YONAKA, MUNA, HAIM, Adele\n\nFacebook | Twitter | SoundCloud | Instagram\n\n","date_published":"2018-02-12T11:44:12.000Z","dek":null,"direction":"ltr","domain":"indietronica.org","excerpt":"Our one to watch in 2018 is BAUM.

Hinter dem Namen steckt der Liverpooler Liam Brown mit\nseinem Soloprojekt. Vom Schreiben der Songs uber das Aufnehmen und schlie\u00dflich\ndas Produzieren seiner Musik, macht er alles in Eigenarbeit.\n\n\u201eNightcall\" von Kavinsky, den meisten wohl bekannt aus dem Film \u201eDrive\",\ngehort wohl zu den prominentesten Songs, die man wahrend einer Autofahrt sehr\ngerne begleitend hort. Insgesamt scheint Automusik etwas zu sein, das sich\neinige Kunstler fur 2018 auf die Fahne geschrieben haben. Zuletzt James Blake\nmit \u201eIf The Car Beside You Moves Ahead\". So duster, wie Blake, kommt Pizzagirl\nnicht daher. Zwar dominiert auch hier der elektronische Beat, doch deutlich\nsanfter und gediegener. Der Beat ladt zum Kopfwippen ein, was durch die ruhige\nStimme Browns unterstutzt wird, die hier und da mit etwas Hall versehen ist.\nEr selbst kundigte vergangenen Freitag seinen neuen Song mit diesen Worten an:\n\u201eStrap in, get cosy and treat your ears to my steamin' hot new tune\n'Carseat'\". Damit hat er selbst wohl alles gesagt und dem kann nur zugestimmt\nwerden. Denn der Song nimmt im wahrsten Sinne des Wortes gut Fahrt auf.\n\nBereits vor einem Monat veroffentlichte Pizzagirl den Track \u201eFavourite Song\",\nder sich wiederum eher mit Kavinskys Song vergleichen lasst. Denn dieser Track\nweist intensive Zuge an Synie-Pop auf, ein 80er-Sound lasst sich ebenfalls\nfeststellen. Auch hier erwahnt Pizzagirl eine Autofahrt und wie er von einer\nParty zuruckfahrt - mit seinem Lieblingssong. Man darf gespannt sein, was man\nvon Liam Brown noch horen wird. \u201eCarseat\" ist definitiv gediegene Automusik.\nVielleicht ein neuer Favourite Song fur die nachste langere, aber auch kurzere\nAutofahrt.\n\n","date_published":"2018-02-12T15:49:14.000Z","dek":null,"direction":"ltr","domain":"thepostie.de","excerpt":"Spoiler: Hier handelt es sich nicht um eine Lady und auch nicht um eine, die bei Lieferheld t\u00e4tig ist.

Only one month\nafter dropping the last single, the indietronica act has come back with new\ntrack _**Carseat**_ , and it's another solid song that cements Pizzagirl as a\n80s-driven master of chilled out electronic sounds.\n\nDrawn from similar creeping drum rhythms as its predeccessor, Carseat is a\nlate-night electro gem that sounds bigger with every listen. From the\nreverberated vocal to the slowly swelling synth lines, it's a track that stays\nclose to its title and sounds like it should soundtrack late evening slow\ndrives.\n\nOver the course of four minutes, the single continually expands into new\nspaces and creates a feeling like you're being propelled towards a blissful\ndestination. And as it cascades into a swirl of echoey vocals at about 3:30,\nyou'll feel like you've arrived.\n\n","date_published":"2018-02-11T18:00:22.000Z","dek":null,"direction":"ltr","domain":"freshbeats365.com","excerpt":"Pizzagirl will take you on a winding road to chilled out electronic bliss.","lang":"en","lead_image_url":"https:\/\/freshbeatsblog.files.wordpress.com\/2018\/02\/pizzagirl-carseat.jpg?w=1200","next_page_url":null,"pages_rendered":null,"rendered_pages":1.0,"title":"Listen\/\/ A spaced out slice of dreamy\u00a0electronica","total_pages":1.0,"url":"https:\/\/freshbeats365.com\/2018\/02\/11\/listen-pizzagirl-carseat\/","word_count":147},{"author":"Marco Lorenzi","content":"Ne avevamo parlato a inizio anno, di un misterioso songwriter e producer tutto\nDIY, dall'eclettico nome d'arte **Pizzagirl**.

The Baltimore-bred, L.A.-based singer-songwriter\ncomes arms with a voice that oozes ferocity, vulnerability and everything in\nbetween -- and though it was mostly harnessed on the acoustic EP, released in\nJanuary, her spring collaboration with Polarcode, \"I Crave You,\" revealed the\nrange longtime followers knew was there. Ward first got notice posting covers\nto YouTube -- (here she is tying Zep's \"Whole Lotta Love\" in knots three years\nago) -- and earned industry notice and writing collaborations with LP, Linda\nPerry and Lauren Christy from The Matrix.\n\nNow fronting an indie-blues quartet, Ward performs as if she's been shot out\nof a cannon, or at least unleashed. (At her residency night Tuesday, she\nclambered atop the bar at Harvard & Stone to hold forth.) \"Make Love to\nMyself\" is the first single from a full-length planned for 2017; it was\nproduced by Grey Goon (U.S. Royalty, Champagne Fever) and features guitarist\nEduardo Rivera (ex-Paperhaus). \"'Make Love' is a cathartic middle finger to\nthose who lack social cues,\" Ward told Ones to Watch, where the video for the\nsong premiered. \"I wrote it after encountering a stranger who made me feel\nuncomfortable. They were shamelessly hitting on me and trying to convince me\nthat just because I was there, I was there for them.\"\n\nThe video, by the way, was filmed by Zack Yan at Harvard & Stone and directed\nby the singer herself. It stars Ward, includes a cameo by the aforementioned\nLP and features Rivera as a bartender.

I don't know anything about them other than that they formed in 2012,\nreleased an album called _We 've Sobered Up_, and they released a Record Store\nDay EP called _Semin_ last year. It 's my understanding that the EP was named\nas a tribute to the band's drummer Kang Semin, who is in a coma. It is _not_ ,\nthankfully, a tribute to former NHLer Alexander Semin, whose career trajectory\nwent very rapidly from \"elite player\" to \"bum\" almost overnight during his\ntenure in Carolina.\n\nI had never heard of the band until I was doing some research today. I sort of\nrandomly ended up on this song, and I really love it. It reminds me of the\ngloriously gloomy but bouncy twee-pop of Camera Obscura and The Concretes\nmixed with something like Veronica Falls. I love it.\n\n**\" Old Town\" by Say Sue Me**  \n\nIt's a song about growing tired and growing old in a town where everyone else\nis leaving. The hero of the story wants to leave and also wants to stay.\nThere's not much to the lyrics, which are in perfect English, but there's a\nlot to the melody and the big hook. There's a bit after the second chorus with\nsome hand claps and vocalizing. It's magnificent, and there's no way you can\nhave a frown on your face while listening.\n\nI've just listened a bunch of times in a row, and it keeps getting better.\n\n_Where We Were Together_ will be released on April 13.

Lead singer Sumi Choi gave us an example:\n\n> Busan is the second largest city in Korea, but everything revolves around\nSeoul, so of course, the underground music scene in Busan suffers a bit.\nAlthough the scene has been around for a while, compared to Seoul, there are\nfewer venues and promoters, and smaller audiences. Nevertheless, there are a\nlot of bands working hard and making their own music, and we're one of them.\n\n>\n\n> Because audiences willing to pay admission can be counted on your fingers,\nwe often play for free at bars where there are drunk people ready to dance to\nany music they hear. We used to play while getting drunk because the bar would\noffer us free beer and we couldn't refuse it.\n\n>\n\n> Our guitarist, Byungyu doesn't enjoy drinking alcohol, but one night in 2013\nin a bar called Basement where we play most often while we were waiting for\nour turn to play, the rest of us were drinking so much that our performance\ngot messy and Byungyu threw down his guitar and made us stop playing.\nActually, the song \"Sorry That I'm Drunk\" from our first album was made with\nthat night in mind. It would be hard to have a situation like that occur if we\nwere in Seoul. We hope we don't do this kind of thing again, but a masterpiece\nwas born from it, and Busan is a lovely city.\n\nAnd their song about it is jaunty as heck.

I\nleave that sort of thing to the experts: schooled savants, Monday morning\nquarterbacks, and the geniuses\/lunatics that grace downtown street corners.\nFor example, Nietzsche had passionate ideas about art and was more articulate\nabout it than I could ever dream to be. \"Art and nothing but art!\" he said,\n\"\u2026the great seduction to life, the great stimulant of life.\"\n\nIf you are a believer in the intoxicating energy produced by art, a force\nbecoming kinetic when music _moves_ someone, then your life needs modern\nclassical composer Poppy Ackroyd, who has orchestrated one of the greatest\nseductions you will hear all year in \"The Calm Before,\" the first taste from\nher forthcoming album  Resolve.\n\nResolve is out February 2 on One Little Indian and is available to pre-order\non CD, DL, and 2xLP here. Self-produced by Ackroyd, Resolve sees the pianist\nand clarinetist experimenting with sound in the studio as usual -- but this\ntime around, manipulated field recordings give way to the participation of\nguest musicians such as Manu Delago (Bjork, Cinematic Orchestra) on the Hang,\nMike Lesirge (Bonobo, Andreya Triana) on clarinet and flute, and prodigy Jo\nQuail on cello. The result is confident set of songs, starting with the\naforementioned \"The Calm Before.\" The track's quiet piano trills and clarinet\n\"percussion\" fluttering as brisk as a sparrow's heartbeat gently drive the\nloveliest 6:09 you'll spend in a long time.\n\nP.S. Ackroyd, soloing and opening for the Joe Acheson-led Hidden Orchestra in\nwhich she performs, will be playing some European dates starting at the end of\nthe month, including two places I have never listed before in a news story\n(and I have been doing this a LONG time).

Upon hearing it,\ncomparisons will abound with the delicate touch of Julie Byrne, but as the\nsong gradually stirs up a little storm it shifts into Angel Olsen territory.\nMoreover, this is Haley Heynderickx stepping up to show that she should be\nconsidered in amongst that revered group of folk singers. As the song creeps\nalong, we start by following Heynderickx down into her own personal\ninsecurities about her life, she considers herself curiously, asking herself\nif she's 'Worth It'. As her convictions start to manifest, the song builds\nsteam to match, only for it to beautifully lapse back again into overthinking\nthings, before rebuilding once more around her rediscovered self-worth.\n\nHeynderickx says the song was written when she was \"living in a house with six\nwomen at the time and attempting to pursue music as more than a bedroom act.\nIn this, I was struggling to find confidence and purpose in it.

The scene plays out over a three-sided struggle between bad\nhabits, romantic anxieties and self-care. \"So I'm just gonna wait for nausea\nto set in \/ I'm peacing out at eleven \/ The friendly girls are trying to\ncomfort me \/ As if I'm a depressed chick at a frat party,\" she sighs early on\nbefore tossing and turning her way through her head with her next move. She\nlater finds a punny way to rhyme words for a solution between \"biblical kind\"\nand the geometrical lingo \"sine\".

However, there's no doubt that she was there on\nmerit; when I caught her at last year's Great Escape Festival in Brighton she\nstood out because her music didn't fit into one simple category (was it jazz,\nindie, soul, pop or something else entirely?) and her songs had a simplistic\ntoned-down style that never seemed to desperate to be heard - it was almost as\nif you had to find them rather them find you. However, once you do discover\nthem, they're strangely captivating. ****\n\nNilufer's latest release is a video for her song _Thanks 4 Nothing_ and\nstrangely captivating is the term that applies here. Nilufer takes the part of\nsome sort of alien tarot reading cult leader, but most importantly to regular\nreaders of Breaking More Waves SHE ENTERS THE MUSICIAN IN THE BATH CLUB,\nchoosing the clothes on water in option. It's bonkers, but that's fine because\nit seems all musicians have such a yearning desire to get in the tub, and the\nrest of the video is equally bonkers.  \n  \nAlso nice use of the Prince style of writing 4 rather than for in the title\nhere.\n\nIn summary: Great song, weird video.
